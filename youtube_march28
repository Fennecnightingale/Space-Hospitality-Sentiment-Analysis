This is a ridiculous fantasy. Why live on a balloon on Venus when you could live on terra firma on the moon or Mars? Moon and Mars have enormous advantages over Venus. Admittedly you could cook your meals by lowering them to the surface then hauling them back up, but that is not enough to compensate for all the disadvantages of life in the Venusian clouds. It isn't practical.	BI-old7YI4I	0	2021-03-28T20:01:32Z	UCOe_cUIirbMQ78EqmHpYK3w	none		Ugz_C99mR0cr1CvxGud4AaABAg

My parents are born in the 1940 and 1950s and when They were  kids  They have   been told   at school that the life was vast  and strong on Venus,   Venus was like the next western  period of the XXe and XXIe  century, so  then their expectations  have been broken in  the 1970s.  The   blindless capitalism has hit   his wall too. Humanity has to be be forged stronger and safer  before it goes further on the cosmos.  Our Solar system is a good examen.

"Wouldn't starlifting be the inevitable result of dysonswarming? I imagine a significant fraction of the radiation generated by a star in a dyson swarm would be reflected back into the star itself. This would heat the star, greatly expanding it and resulting in huge amounts of outgassing. The resulting outgassing would probably be collected by swarm units and stored as fuel reserves for fusion reactors. Eventually the star would evspprate away completely and the swarm would disperse to the interstellar medium or remain in orbit around eachother having completely eaten the parent star.
A dyson swarm like this could completely dismantle its star in a matter of centuries and may not leave a significant heat signature in its wake.
Although such a civilization is very likely to disperse to other star systems and do the same."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2020-10-02T16:51:13Z	UCfEGc3ouAU-0jP-2IuitMEw	none		UgzZdQ17pzbm1lZm78J4AaABAg

All videos on Venus seem to make a critical mistake. They mention the super slow rotation as a problem but fail to mention the constant wind which is faster at higher altitudes. At 55km - the ideal altitude of 1000bar and 16°C average - the winds provide one rotation around the planet every 152.6 earth hours at the equator. A far cry from 1.9 times per year. A blimp would go along this wind seeing a 3.2 earth day, day and night. Venus should be seen as a water planet. Its surface is really the bottom of an ocean, not a place we would live any more than here on Earth at 1km deep in the ocean. More than likely if organic life exists on Venus we will find traces of it not at the surface deep in the CO2 ocean, but rather around 55km above the Venusian surface. #teamvenera	BI-old7YI4I	0	2020-09-20T17:01:18Z	UCo2mFO9SLx4E2_bauLP74CQ	none		Ugwkufrv6UZp0mfZdg54AaABAg

You can't colonize a planet by putting floating cities, but rather a floating platform for terraforming Venus by controlling the traffic of drone shuttles grouping themselves in delivering ice meteoroids so that the the temperatures would lower in Venus surface.  Enough till Venus becomes stable to support life. This operation will require all engineering driplines, scientist, and biologist.

"A real spaceship for distant travels should look like a metal jellyfish some of the arms are engines and some are radiators 
cargo ships traveling with them should have umbrella cap that turns sideways  when attached to the ship behind the forward bell 
and small atmospheric shuttle should be docked inside the rear between the engines also to act as backup propulsion if needed
inside the ship there should be two or more beaded torus   ( see generation ship animation ) this bead system should help with speeding up and slowing down although I think the beads should be rounder in shape than that animation  
3 shuttles 3 cargo support ships the navigation bell should be made of thick materials and each piece should be able to roll the damaged area in so it can be fixed  small panels on the sides should adjust for broken surfaces a bit  sensors and navigation equipment should be between the cargo ships caps but they need to fold back when damaged  power source  should be fusion reactor and anti proton /proton stream reaction engines  you can't store enough anti-matter and it's dangerous so just make during flight  you need a fusion reactor to power the internal ring needed to make the anti-protons but stream reaction should produce more power than the fusion itself  better to have more power than you need or not work the reactor too hard during flight anyway I know you can only go as fast 24 % safely   I wish I could show you the design in my head but can't make cgi animations so you'll have live with my description  sorry    AK"	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2021-03-26T01:23:10Z	UC-zyQVuVeQD1zwziiNWv01g	none		UgzvGAUXGWMySIzL_l14AaABAg

"Interesting enough but you need to first learn how to present in a more compelling. interesting, personable way that has a better flow to it.
You also need to improve the pronunciation of many words including ""burn"", ""repairs, ""air"", ""there"". ""near"", ""mirror"", future"", ""barrier"", ""universe"", ""ever"", ""learning"", ""words"", the list is almost endless.
Yes I did watch but I skipped over a good deal because I couldn't stand your presentation style, and I'm certain I'm not alone in that
Suffice to say, Isaac, if you wish to truly successfully capture and retain an audience you have a lot of work to do, as it stands, your presentation is more likely to turn an audience away, Since your subject is compelling please do make that effort so I and others can enjoy your presentations rather than forcing ourselves to bear your speech to do so."

Why would you push the comet in? I think the first thing would be to decelerate it, so it is no longer in orbit, then perhaps push it slightly sunward so it does not take forever to fall into the inner system. But then, when it arrives in the vicinity of the orbit of Jupiter or the asteroid belt (You orbital mechanics folks determine exactly where.) you would need to decelerate it so it would not just blast past the destination and fall into the sun.

"Very nice to see Elmer Fudd got work narrating youtube vids.
Design elements that are realistic (and should therefore exist in serious sci-fi) are but not limited to: modular design in general, allowing easy expansion of additional living quarters, additional engines, additional fuel reserves, cargo holds, etc. sensible engine configuration. Attainting speed is half of the coin. Let’s say you could reach 20 million miles per hour. You need to slow down before reaching your destination. Therefore, engines need to be either, rotatable, or a double ended design, both forward and aft, from a centralized power source. On the subject of centralization, the command decks (two) should be atop and below the main body of the ship, akin to a tank turret or zeppelin gondola allowing for maximum view in any direction. The best design would be a central power structure with engines pointing in both directions, command “whiskers” centrally located down the long axis, above & below. Overall surrounded by two modular/expandable “cylinders” comprised of various modules (science, storage, living quarters)... gapped centrally to avoid the command “whiskers” and set to rotate. This would provide a number of solutions, artificial gravity, the ability to drop shipments from orbit, and entire modules serve as life boats which can be jettisoned in a cam type manner, putting them all string-like arc, simplifying rescue. Each module would have it’s own dedicated (and shareable via modular design) water storage on the “bottom” outside area, both providing potable water and radiation shielding from any outside sources. The command crew work shifts would be dictated by the rotation of the cylinder shells, because the doors from whiskers to modules would align only every so often, but work shifts are not a new concept for people. Lastly, maneuvering thrusters. Lots of them. Guesstimate how many is “more than you will ever need,” and then double that amount. No matter how state of the art your engines might be, if you cannot point yourself toward home, you’re not going to get there. There’s lots of stuff out there, asteroids, etc, that may be in your path. Don’t assume docking collars will be aligned for you by god. Don’t assume gravitational pulls on a ship will be constant, moons on the far side of a planet for example will increase the combined gravitational pull (tidal effect) on a ship, and you’ll need those thrusters."

Problems.    You are in space for a long time.   In this case a very long time.    Anything at all goes wrong and help is not coming.    The spacecraft must be armed in some fashion so it can defend itself from things like rocks etc.   The smart move here would be to go as a group and help each other if need be and land as a group.....and most importantly.

@Fred Cink  Outside of this world..   there is only one flag.  An earth flag.   Anything else means jack sh!t.   Some loser government trying to lay claim to something else.  Only going to cause more reasons for wars.   Flags are useless.  An excuse to fight over what....nothing.   Once more people evolve...we won't have but one flag.   That could be closer then expected.  People everywhere are getting choked with the government .....failures.... revolution is brewing....in a lot of places.   Anybody putting a flag up should think to themselves.  what exactly am i supporting?   Some loser then is only in it for cash.   That is basically what most of us call a leader these days.   The leaders look at us as votes.  Say whatever BS they need to say to get in office..... and then do absolutely nothing about the problems.  Some of them make the problems worse.  Most of them just do sh!t for themselves.   I lost all faith in government.   It is a failed experiment.  So burn the flags.... all of them.   We would be better off.

"No. 
Man will never go to Mars - not in 50 years anyway. 
I mean, i see the furture is coming at us really fast with Moore's law and euv lithography, and it is very exciting, but most os what folk believe about space travel is based on hoax. 
And then folk are keen to keep up the hoax, so that there kind of rules out any moonlandings or Mars trips. 
In other words, before any Mars trips we must first disavow ourselves from the Apollo hoax. 
It is increasingly difficult to maintain ideas of Cold space, or 4k space, as people gradually become more exposed to the reality of satalite tech. 
At the moment we have students of satalite design who have no idea about the ambient temperature of sunlight in space.(it's 120°C). 
How can anyone design circuitry without knowing the heat of the environment of the working plant?
Also radiation is gradually becoming more relevant to more technology in space. At some point we will need to move on from the Apollo religion and just start admitting the truth. 
It was all a big hoax. 
And it wasn't a patriotic thing, that was just a smoke screen. It was more a national shame for the country that called itself the USA."	VQY3qWZMIl8	0	2020-03-10T03:47:45Z	UC-qosgiTvySVmR3botZECUA	none		UgwQbZn_Jk0m1g8t91Z4AaABAg

"It is nice to dream of “colonizing mars” or even other planets and exoplanets. However the reason cited such as “overpopulation”does not wash.Whenever we speak of “overpopulation” we rarely refer to countries with a high population density such as Japan, but to poor African countries in countries like Africa. If we consider overpopulation” is about poverty and lack of resources rather than “population density “ in number of people per square km (Is Japan “overpopulated”)then how do we expect poor countries to pay for atrip to mars?It would be much cheaper for poeple to build skyscrapers, go underground, under the sea, or even populate “hostile” places like Antarctica.Living in antarctica is a picnic compoared to living on mars.

With people living on skyscrapers,underground , under the seas or in antarctica there would be much more land freed for agriculture to support several times the world’s current population.

So you think living in antarctica , under the sea, underground and on skyscrapers would be “expensive” and beyond our means? Well going to mars has its own benefits which have nothing to do with the “population problem”.However colonizing mars is NOT a solution to current population problems which have more to do with poverty and politics rather than population density per  se."

happy new year. - I have been thinking that if we were to colonize Mars and create an atmosphere, we would have to, in order to hold on to the oxygen, create a magnetic field there. The sun has a giant magnetic field and since magnets affect each other, a magnetic field on Mars would be affected by the sun and create a significant imbalance in the solar system. Is that common sense in that regard. That alone will make the project impossible. Kind regards from Denmark.

The fact that we would use less resources might not be true though, as we would firstly use a lot of rocket fuel and build large rockets using Earth's resources. Secondly, we would also expend resources on building things for the colonization of Mars. Remember, rockets not only have to carry the load of people, but also equipment for the colonization of Mars, as well as things like parts for houses.

"I have looked at a lot of videos about colonizing the moon & Mars. And I haven't found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.

The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. 

After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  

This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.

We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.

"There's nothing that says these people have privacy, or, alone time. Seems Mars is going to be a prison for probably it's first 100 to 200 years. 
I do not rep( intentionally) other people on this. But would you volunteer to live in prison? Many people in prison lack the ability to stop themselves from memorizing other people's ways, patterns( with an intention behind it), and manipulating that information. So not only does one not experience privacy but one is also constantly for their rights, what few rights that still exist.

I think we need a faster transportation system yes Elon musk star ships is good to send a couple hundred humans, but a million we need a faster ship that can get to mars in a couple hours and and hold a couple thousand people and once we have. Also we need  to start terraforming mars we need a mirror the size of Lake Michigan covering the poler ice caps to melt it releasing gasses then it will make mars have a thicker atmosphere and will have air pressure than start making factories that produce large amounts of oxygen and nitrogen and carbon dioxide over the course of a century	Gcnf5BdLXxw	0	2020-07-25T17:33:23Z	UCQZzgZKCT4Kw9_KzEDTcPyA	none		UgzY4lawWIC4CaI4V6x4AaABAg

Massive colonisation of another planet is just impossible right now. And we have just no need in it. Maybe in 2000 years, after a couple of atomic wars. And the first thing to do will be to explore the nearest asteroid belt to gain rare resourses. The recourses should be used to built space automatic forges. These forges, in their turn, should build giant spaceships, that will contain almost all infrastractural needs for humanity to colonise another planet. This is a HUGE work, that will demand an effort of all the humankind, not just one country. And such work is possible only then, when we will have to deside: whether we unite or die. Nowadays we are able to send on Mars several astronauts or cosmonauts or taikonauts in order to fulfill someone's ambitions to put a flag there first and die. The best option now is to build as much robots as possible and send them to every possible interesting corner of our solar system to gain information and process it on Earth.

Okay video, but there are something wrong in the basic. We will here at earth get a big problem with overpopulation and pollution in THIS CENTURY, we are in no way ready to colonize Mars or anything else. Even if we move 1 milion people to Mars, there will still be 7800 millions people back here at earth, we would not be able to measure here at earth, that we colonized Mars. So when the clima-activits says there are no planet B, they are right. Lets take this disquission in year 2500, maybe we then have some ideas!

You lost me when you said forests are being cut down at an alarming rate. If you don’t know that forests are flourishing in the US then you don’t have anything to say that I can trust. All industrialized countries have trouble maintaining their populations and all indications are that as less developed countries become more developed their populations will also stop growing. I am old enough to know that our world is cleaner and better than at anytime since the industrial revolution. The world is good enough but you can never count out a natural catastrophe. Good luck.

How stupid. The planet is not overpopulated. Have you ever flown transcontinental over the US. It is almost 100% empty land - not cities. Do the same with South America, Africa, The Arctic, The Antarctic, Australia, etc. 

YUP! all of it is NEARLY EMPTY!! We could grow our population at the same rate as now for a thousand years and not fill up all that land. But if you walk around New York or Los Angeles or Boston, yeah they are crowded. But ONLY because humans have a tendency to cluster. Not because there is no land."

Note: 

There is no such thing as man made global warming. 

Thus, mankind has no control over the Earth's Climate. As far as ""climate change"" is concerned the climate has been changing since the earth was first formed and will continue changing (on its own) long past the days when mankind is long forgotten. When you add all that to the fact that plants and trees and, thus, animal life (who eats and otherwise consumes plants and trees) thrive, the more Carbon Di-Oxide they consume, you begin to see that the Earth was designed for much higher quantities of CO2 than we currently have. Thats because there were many times in history when the Earth had a much healthier plant infrastructure than it does now or has had for the past few thousand years.  (For example, the very healthy plants and giant conifer trees the dinosaurs consumed to get as big as they were.)

Although this is a good video in many respects, it does not do credit to the technology we already have. As I pointed out recently on my channel, we already have a transportation breakthrough. One over half a century old. Nuclear Thermal engines. We actually designed a vessel, the Copernicus, powered by three of these engines, designed to traverse the distance from Earth to Mars in a mere 100 days. What stopped us was not technology, but idiot politicians who decided that it was too expensive and that waging war in Iraq was a better idea.  Had we not canceled this program, we would have landed humans on Mars in 2018. I'm not kidding. This technology dates back to Von Braun and the Saturn V.  What has prevented us from exploring Mars and establishing a colony is a lack of will. All of the technology already exists.

When people tell you, they are going to Mars, they are lying to you. Mars is generall pain in the backside. First, their is not enough air to breath, so even if there was oxyen, the pressure would be to low, but there is enough air, to be a ruin everything. There is no magnetic field on Mars, so you will have to have shielding, just to not die of radition. The ground is poisonous, and always will be. It's at the bottem of a gravity well, so just to drop a few men off, and lift off the surface again, you would need a whole civilization. You could find a way around all this stuff, except, if you did, you just build a space station. The upside of a space station is, you don't have to deal with an atmosphere.  There are gravity stable spots all over the solar system, called L5 locations. There is one near Earth that's four hundred thousand mile wide. Four hundred thousand miles? Holy carp, we could put  the whole human race in that, and we would get lost. The worst reason for going to Mars is, it will always be a few days away. The human race would be like the donkey chasing the carrot hanging from a stick. We would run, and run, and never get there. The second worst reason for going to Mars is, it's a bad idea, but great excuse for a worse Idea. The world's powers want nuclear rocket ships, so we can zip around. One nuclear rocket ship would be like a hundred nuclear accidents happen the  whole time it's in operation. We could have a space presence in an Earth L5, and L4 location, and it would be so close, you could spend the  weekend on Earth, and go back for the weekday.  Mars is just a lie, meant to lead humanity around by the nose.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-10-19T11:22:21Z	UCaA-WWcxeNdq1VqRTbrFo5A	none		UgzjqkLyLXmqNzfh8VF4AaABAg

@Purvanya Tyagi So, G forces would be minimal due to the slow acceleration. Keep in mind that over time, this is an extremely fast engine, but it does not reach full thrust instantly, unlike chemical engines, instead, over a span of days. so g forces are not a concern. To answer your other question, deceleration is a bit trickier, a possible solution is flipping the vehicle over, so that the engine faces your destination, and then decelerating to a reasonable speed by turning on the engine again over a time span of days. Hope that answers your questions!	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-12-06T20:18:00Z	UCXrLMhVLTjuBodS0MzyPoJQ	none	Ugy2jesIAbbWrGLm_Wl4AaABAg	Ugy2jesIAbbWrGLm_Wl4AaABAg.9CSToXscz9e9GwYcxNTCon

The problem is achieving thrust of any kind in a vacuum doesn't work. When you apply force to any physical object with mass you receive equal but opposing force back, when you apply a force/thrust/ propulsion to nothing, nothing happens. You could never accelerate or slow down. Same is true for sound/communication transmission, sound waves require a medium to travel through.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-06-09T04:51:04Z	UCG9EgXlau5zm-zwBb1qhXog	none		UgwVXEgMPS0mi7KA0VB4AaABAg
"@chris trull Rocket engine doesnt push against nothing, it creates thrust using the mass of the fuel that is combusted in the combustion chamber.
""In a rocket engine , fuel and a source of oxygen, called an oxidizer, are mixed and exploded in a combustion chamber. The combustion produces hot exhaust which is passed through a nozzle to accelerate the flow and produce thrust. For a rocket, the accelerated gas, or working fluid, is the hot exhaust produced during combustion.""

Or get to mars in under 60 seconds using zpe tech which btw forms it's own ionosphere capable of deflecting spacejunk. A secret project insider exposed a black project on his deathbed confession to reveal there are craft that can run to Sirius B in just 15 minutes. That's nearly 6 trillion miles away, vs Mars which is only about 177 million. The craft's ionosphere bends into a teardrop shape, squeezing through space propelled by neutrino pressure. Electron neutrinos travel near the speed of light they think. That doesn't mean a sailboat's speed is limited to the speed of the wind, since in this case it would relate to a relative air pressure of that strong enough to keep atoms from flying apart.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-02-07T20:17:43Z	UCMynpYBvnpweZaz3teLvCSA	none		UgyO3yNFjE07LjVpXY14AaABAg

I'd love to see ~6 Starships docked into a massive inflatable space station, and launch it to the Mars transit orbit by using the Starships as boosters. We'd deliver a gateway station to the red planet, if that's not the coolest thing I don't know what is! It would also allow more cargo space, more living space for the passengers, and create redundancy by including multiple modules and Starships if something goes wrong etc. Multiple Starships should be enough to haul it to the Mars orbit until some of them will disembark and land. Once it's time to head home, the Starships will dock with the station and haul it back to Earth. #wdtj why aren't we doing this?!	5nE3UO1kqv0	1	2021-03-09T16:06:50Z	UCk0OlDL_IiMTFZ4CSY5-apA	none		UgwcW91L8nV9q7m61KZ4AaABAg

This is really impressive, and I’m really excited to see where it will go, but I guess my main problem with it is that it would be really difficult to incorporate windows into the inflatable design. I guess you could put the windows in capsules attached to the inflatable part, but I feel like that would kind of defeat the purpose, because the windows wouldn’t be in the main section. Who knows, maybe they’ll figure it out.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2021-02-01T03:00:06Z	UCzgW-Gz3I_0otzvee1KLJeQ	none		UgyZH7wVMTQW_NWiMrx4AaABAg

In hindsight, NASA's interest in having BEAM attached to the space station was a way to tie up the program so that Biggilow would 't do anything else with it.

What if the astronauts personal weight was less then the 100 pounds if that is the measurement ruler or if it was less then 50 Kilograms if that is the measurement ruler would that not give it more lift energy because the difference was set on whole numbers and not fractions. Example: 100/2 half the payload at first separation then 1/2 the remaining the 1/2 of that and so forth until we reach a ratio that includes the astronauts weight in the last capsule segment the. That equation determines the whole equation before the start on how much of what and when you need to do the separations that is determined on the initial weight of the astronaut on board for exact energy needed for lift to occur out of the electromagnetic grid and out of the gravitational pull. The secret is the persons weight.	RVMZxH1TIIQ	0	2021-03-27T19:50:58Z	UCWhWxR4CPeD8mB0Ww5GK-2w	none		UgwnvkhfXKM2tUabrnZ4AaABAg

"Debt is a construct of the Archons & Yaldabaoth.  If we are all essentially divine sparks of whatever source sparks come from, the source wants to tax us for ""being""?  Yaldabaoth's solution to ""chaos"" is to micromanage it and try to control every part of it.  This appears in humanity's experience as governments, laws, rights, penalties, punishment and any mindfuckery that leads to emotions like fear, shame, anger, hopelessness, enslavement, disassociation.

You may roleplay/pretend existence is taxable and by doing so you ""select"" those forms of prison.  I don't disagree that our collective earth experience is a prison, but not because of simulation concepts like time and gravity.  Birth is when you enter the prison.  If you awaken enough, then upon death or perhaps even sooner (I am as ignorant as every other form of sentience in this prison-of-ignorance), otherwise death is just a stroll in the prison yard before you are returned to a fleshy cage.

Focusing on the universe, the cosmos, gravity wells and all the other phenomena of forms is the very lure/trance/illusion which distracts the divine spark from explore that which exists within each of us.  Nothing ""out here"" will enhance your wakefulness, it is all just a perpetual spiritual coma.  If you know yourself, you know everything.  That is your opportunity in this Ignorance Trap.  As long as something or everything in the realms of creation ""matter"" you are light trapped in ""matter"".

People are dumb, so nosy. Everyone wants to know everything but there’s somethings that are best left unknown. Humans need to stop trying to be God. Humanity isn’t God and it’s that thought process that got us stuck in the misfortune we’re in now. Stay in your lane, it’s that simple. When it comes to spirituality and connecting with the divine I understand that in fact that’s what we’re designed for. But all this space nonsense traveling to Mars trying to escape earth. You’d be amazed at the places you could go if you meditate.  Mark my words people are going to go to Mars and find themselves in some crucial predicaments. Mars was not made for humans. If it was people would already be there. This is where humanity falls trying to force situations into play. It’s not intelligence it’s stupidity. The only way humans can inhabit Mars is by staying inside of a glass dome or walking around in space suits. That’s not natural, not to mention the materials you’ll need CO2 and oxygen. Once you run out your done. Regardless even if you had unlimited resources it doesn’t change the fact that your living in a glass dome and walking around in space suits. Again I say there’s nothing natural about that. True life is all about nature and nature is natural.	RVMZxH1TIIQ	1	2021-03-25T01:23:03Z	UCqYvRxGeEKecMejt1siIOpA	none		UgyPGXpGHMhha474s5h4AaABAg

"This is very informative but earth doesn’t exist in a vacuum. You cannot solve a problem with the same lower mindset that created it. Where you pay attention you tend to go. 

But humans have not figured out their place in the universe and won’t listen when I try to tell them in my writings books I videos. 

The idea of manifestation applies to the mindset of large groups. So what evolutionary theory tells us is the same thing as what rockets roughly do. Not every species can make it. Not every person. 

But when you figure out what gravity is then we will. That’s what I am trying to give people. What gravity is. It’s not a prison once you see the next level. We tend to use metaphors in imperfect ways. Gravity is really something else. All life is. If we don’t straighten out our metaphors in context then we will never survive.

People really ought to listen to me because I can show them. I made a few videos and I have written the foundation 20 years ago and now I am writing the keys to the future of life.

"No such thing as Gravity!! 
It’s called magnetism, stop it with the gravity. We get further away from the earth and the magnetic field gets weaker and weaker and you become more and more buoyant. Everything is magnetised. We don’t even live on a ball, that’s a lie to make us feel insignificant, useless, worthless and limited by resources. It also serves to keep us in a state of fear every time we look up- in our subconscious we feel in a constant state of fear due to being told we could die from rocks of cosmos coming through and killing us all with a big meteorite- bollocks, never gonna happen- I never even seen a shooting star shoot upwards because it can’t happen but it would if we was on a ball earth. We record everything with our ears and eyes from birth and the first 6 years is so very important. As soon as you record from a local source (tv or radio) that you are in immediate danger, you shut down the subconscious and we go into monkey mind (10% conciiisness for your 3D senses and your creative side (Divine side or creative side)  goes into hibernation. We are kept in a constant and a perpetual state of fear and it works. The lie of gravity started off with Freemasons such as Eisenstein and gravity is just a the sort and has actually never been proven. Cause and effect experiments have been done and we are living on a toroidal field. We each have a toroidal field comping out from our heart up to “2 meters” or “6ft”
Modern science tells you half truths and half lies. We have been conditioned into believing all the lies and non of the truths. 

What is the darkest dark?
What is the lightest light? 
Would both blind you if you looked at them?
Sun? (Jesus the Sun of god- so pure if you looked at it, it would blind you. 
Darkness? If you looked at it, it’s would blind you from seeing anything else as the darkest dark is nothingness. 
What is the most extreme of colds and the most extreme of heat? 
Now- what is the evilest thing you have heard of that has happened? And is it happening or happened on earth? 
Yes, it most likely is!

They wanted to persuade the high holy men of the world it was a globe, once they all believed it they all gave up on God and then the high holy men neglected us and their duty. 
It was the devils plan all along to deceive us of just one belief and that was the only thing he had to debunk. Every single holy book stated that we was on a “flat plain” and if he could change their minds and deceive man. Men and women of the world stopped going to the church as much due to tv being more interesting what going to the “moon” and making new exciting news- he would finally have their religious beliefs in shatters and go about changing man to woman and woman to man. We have schools teaching children how to play with themselves from 4 yrs old. Same sex marriage promoted in schools and aromatisers put into men’s aftershave and deodorant to give hormone imbalance. Bill gates is trying to change night to day and day to night with a ballon for “global warming”. Our air, water and food is toxic and poison and our minds and ears are filled with crap. We have busy schedules and even busier minds. We don’t have time for our children and palm em off onto the tv for the elite to control and programme. Playing fields and activities are no longer safe if even available. We have been programmed to think it’s ok to let our kids act the way they do because we cannot control them without being frowned upon and our children’s future looked ever more bleak with toddlers seeing faceless people (demons) as normal and someone with a smile as disgusting because we are muzzled dogs looking to bite with infectious saliva if the muzzle comes off. They will pay the ultimate price and with that so shall we, for it is for them that we live and if their spirit dies- we ultimately fail as a species 

The devil is with us and the elite are trying to bring it on Board.

"1:18
Gravity used the energy to convince particles to group together to make my body? How? What kind of energy was that? Show it to me. 

From what I've learned, it is not energy that convinces stuff to move, but mass. 
And mass seems to conserve energy in the strong, weak and EM forces, etc. That's where some of it is hidden. But there is more hidden in places we aren't allowed to look, so nevermind that. Nothin' to see there. Move along. 

So, Protons will collect Electrons using the Strong Force. It takes an ordinary amount of energy to break that bond but when it happens, an exponentially larger amount of energy is released from some additional mysterious hiding place. 

Nothing like this seems to happen when we leave the planet in a rocket. Only the ordinary amount of energy is necessary. Then, instead of exploding, we're free to roam about the solar system intact. 

So, where is this debt?

Okay, you escape the planet, not the universe! Also, your spirit isn’t held here by gravity! Also the universe hasn’t always been here and it won’t be here forever! If you have wickedness in your heart, your spirit,  then you’ll go to a dark place! If you’re righteous and have light in your heart you’ll go to the Kingdom of God! Have you noticed that all those people who had a near death experience and saw the Kingdom of God were forced to come back? It’s like the story in the Bible, their robes weren’t white! They had wickedness in their heart! They were forced to come back!	RVMZxH1TIIQ	0	2021-03-18T19:06:07Z	UC2fFJaY5oiRN4E1gw_B4lAA	none		Ugy4GGAh7TlyvlQQc-p4AaABAg
"@I love Jesus What I am using right now isn't artificial intelligence. And even if it were, nobody is claiming or intending it to be some sort of new god. That is preposterous. And you also didn't even answer my questions from previous comments, which makes me think that you simply don't have an answer to them.

And I meant one life as in one life in THIS life. Pardon the misunderstanding there.

Also, while we don't know enough about consciousness and what happends after death, we can't just jump to pre-determined conclusions without any evidence. This isn't truth of anything, therefore. I also never said that my idea was true either, but you seem to think that.

'Take away your spirit and you no longer breathe! I guess you haven’t seen something die that had a spirit cause I have seen the spirit leave the body!'
The existence of spirits have never been proven either. And if you can somehow see it with the naked eye, then why has none of our modern technology, which is much more accurate than the human senses, been able to detect such a thing? Why has it never been observed apart from your alleged sighting?

'I know the Truth in my heart and that’s all that matters!'
Feelings can deceive. And we have a long list of records of people who thought they had experienced something divine, yet had a rational explanation behind it all along. In fact, you'd be amazed if you knew how much the brain can deceive itself.

'There is a God whether you believe it or don’t believe it!'
Then when am I going to see proof of his existence? I have waited a long time and spoke with lots of people about the subject. Still nothing has emerged. No hide and seek game lasts this long.

'Go ahead and live life to the fullest, have all the orgasms you want because that’s what it’s all about, sex!'
Way to assume while you don't know the first thing about me. I don't appreciate that, you know. And I don't even see what's wrong about orgasms in general. Is it because lust is a sin, because a book says so?

'You can say I’m wrong but all you have to do is look at all of the monkeys, including you, in this damn world!'
Well, someone sounds very sure of themselves. Careful you don't start becoming arrogant, because I know for a fact that pride is also a sin.

'I’m sure God’s manifested Himself to you before but you refused to believe.'
Look, it's very simple. Until I actually see evidence, I am not going to put my faith into a supernatural sky daddy which is *believed* to exist among thousands of other gods, every single one of them claiming they are the true religion. Until then, I will remain an atheist.

'Thanks and have a miserable day in your hell that you’ve created!'
I have had a decent life because of hard work and not generally being a jerk to others. I think I will be fine."	RVMZxH1TIIQ	0	2021-03-22T21:05:17Z	UCpp0uJRzY70rGQpzhHXvVnA	none	Ugy4GGAh7TlyvlQQc-p4AaABAg	Ugy4GGAh7TlyvlQQc-p4AaABAg.9L23Ug6dvWl9LC_J-7fWgW

Oh, and about those logistics - artificial atmosphere that can be easily regenerated, water generation in abundance because we're a thirsty lot, artificial gravity so we don't loose our bones, and, most of all, shielding so that our DNA doesn't get shredded by cosmic radiation, will all need creating, not to mention building a ship that can hold all of humanity (or several ships, but even then the weight would be daunting) if the idea is escape from catastrophe and extinction - unless you're planning on leaving most of humanity behind to perish in the impact.  In which case, who decides who stays and who goes?  And what if Alpha Centauri's only habitable (by humans) planet already has occupants? Pipe dreaming is lots of fun, but none of this is feasible or practical in 30 years.  Why don't we concentrate on saving our own planet from being destroyed by US, and work on asteroid deflection technology instead?

"This is really making me wonder. The schwarzschild kugelblitsz is really interesting because with lasers that powerful we would be able to use the lasers to test Mallets time machine to send messages to the past as far back as was when they're first turned on. So we might theoretically receive the results of any journey from our future selves before we even send the ship. Would we be able to record the messages/information and then give the ship a new target destination or would some kind of quantum eraser effect delete the ""waveform"" of possible information when we observe it?  If we could save the information it would be like a crystal ball that allowed us to literally choose our future by selecting it from possible ones. Even better lets assume by then we have matrix like VR, we could have the information from the future represented there to actually experience it and would essentially have explored everything that was possible for us to explore without actually having to go do it. It would be like a temporal internet where all possible timelines of humanity were contributing to a ""waveform"" of possible information while at the same time never actually contributing. If observing collapses the waveform then maybe you would have to ask a question and some crazy AI that wouldn't be able to actually read the information giving you the answer until ironically we first know the question we need ask in order to preserve the the waveform. The implications to freewill and reality if any of this was possible is really messed up, never mind the fact that if it worked we probably wouldn't be building a ship to physically explore the universe but a computer powerful enough to be able to handle all the possible information. I'm sure there's holes in my thinking but hear me out, what if the solution to the fermi paradox is once we reach the threshold of this laser and information technology we no longer have a need to explore to survive because we could create closed time curvatures containing everything we need and would have no reason to leave the universe we create for ourselves because we would be able to experience what ever we wanted in it."

Bro, I'm a big fan of your show, and i really hate to be the naysayer, but please stop saying we can travel at speeds approaching the speed of light by conventional means. The electrons that bind atoms into molecules which comprise our physical bodies have mass, and therefore cannot reach speed c (light speed.) What is the speed of the electron? A quick internet query states that the electron is traveling at about 2,200 kilometers per second. That's less than 1% of the speed of light. However, liquid fluorocarbon breathing solutions should theoretically reduce cellular damage significantly due to cryogenic pressure changes within our cells. Being that Crocodiles and Tibetan grasshoppers, et al, can freeze and return to life in the spring, this will probably be the most likely means to circumvent (t) for deep space travel. Worm holes and warp drives would be great- but until they are implemented and tested safely, lets please not accelerate ourselves into oblivion. oh and just say no to black holes. thanks!

"@Muttler .. The craft is irrelevant, our technology is the problem. Any journey that would be even years would be too long. We haven't even gone to Mars yet and that's in our backyard, the problem isn't getting there the problem is surviving the radiation and the journey itself.

This is like SETI looking for Radio waves for an ""Advanced Race."" Imagine an advanced race communicating over just 40 light years. ""Hello, did you arrive safely"" .. ""Yes"" .. by the time you received the reply if your lifespan is only 80 years you'll be dead to hear their reply and that's it. No, instead radio is something we use like we used the telegraph until we figure out something better and faster. 

Everything is _space magic_ until we figure it out, and as I mentioned we're right around the corner to AI.

I think you missed a very simple drive.  A simple magnetic catapult using the solar wind as it’s reaction mass.

When humans speak about space travel they always talk about different propulsion systems. But space is a substance and a lot of different matter coexist in space. So we need also a very strong shield and maybe an shield is more important than a high speed propulsion systems. An warpdrive seems to be logic, but i don't like to collide with particals, some dust or small rocks. Shielding against the dangers of space, is the most important goal in human space travel.

Except... That's not how orbital mechanics works. The transfer window between objects is never when they are the closest together. Since everything in the universe is moving. Unless you're being really inefficient, the amount of time it will take to travel to another star is allways going to be half of the time it takes the sun to orbit Sagittarius. If you try to go faster you'll just have to do a lot bigger capture maneuver. And there is absolutely no way that a gravity assist off of any object in the proxima centauri system can even get close to capture. So all of this is Bullshit.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	1	2021-02-16T12:35:28Z	UCj-sR15_TNnrEcXnjKl0Wbw	none		UgylwMFxQlQRi4hemOh4AaABAg

No, it's impossible. The only reason why we can detect things like pulsars and black holes is because they gravitationally bend light around them. Scientists aren't even confident that proxima centauri B exists since they have never directly observed it. What scientists actually do is observe the stars brightness and if they notice even a few photon change in brightness, then that means there is a planet in front of the star. This is a hugely flawed system as determining its size, shape, nature and location and eccentricity is next to impossible.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2021-02-16T12:43:34Z	UCj-sR15_TNnrEcXnjKl0Wbw	none	UgxfYhS1v_PqegdpM0t4AaABAg	UgxfYhS1v_PqegdpM0t4AaABAg.9JZcX53bied9Jp7rdtFm3j

As well as we cant agree on freedom too many pos want to tell how one life form should and governments want to control all life. We cant even agree that we should love how we wish, every pos want to have control over how lige ahould be lived, hopely we die human life clearly doesnt deserve to live were far to focused on killing one another and controlling each other. Amd thats no way to live.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2021-01-19T00:44:59Z	UC8SaEje5jP0duK2H84yAALw	none		UgzRY7YqY4RXBjsev1N4AaABAg

"There is only 1 realistic method for interstellar travel, the constant 1g acceleration method, with this a ship can get to Alpha Centauri in 3.6 ship/7.3 Earth years (and that includes turning the ship around half way there and decelerating) and have gravity the whole way. What's needed for this to happen is a fission rocket that can put out thrust for long periods and doesn't consume hydrogen. A 10 ton ship would need a mere 10 tons of continuous thrust.

Once we learn to travel at the speed of light, age becomes a weird thing. The concept of time changes once you're traveling in space at the speed of light. Age is based off the earth's rotations but days are more or less different when you are on earth compared to in space. Technically you'd age slower over a long period of time in space. Theoretically it wouldn't be anything massive but technically you legit would have aged differently.	OYAgcS31-p0	0	2021-03-08T04:09:28Z	UC2F31y5OA6i6uBYZmHHjJGQ	none		UgycRw_Yf_4gD_TBcLl4AaABAg

There’s a difference between the most dangerous thing you have done VS the most dangerous thing you’ve taken part in. One relies on your ability strictly, the other relies on other circumstances. Frontflip barspin on a scooter across a wooden box jump was probably the most dangerous thing I ever did, and I do it for fun, but driving a car is definitely the most dangerous thing I have participated in and I do it just for work. In my opinion, it’s more dangerous when you have little to no control over what’s happening (I.e. me out on the road or you floating around in space)	Zo62S0ulqhA	0	2021-03-07T09:01:00Z	UC_FK9AiG7wNiBiasm2xW-Bg	none		UgwRJR2WwxkGX_OU4dB4AaABAg

Hi I don't know how old you are but there was an admiral named Richard Byrd and in the 1950s he got on national TV and he told all the people alive then in our country who were my great grandparents grandparents and parents that there was unexplored land beyond the pole. no one really truly understood what we were being told because we have been lied to about the reality of Earth we are on a much bigger world and the exit out of what we think of as Earth and into the much bigger world is in Antarctica and that is why there's a military treaty with all the governments of the world to keep people out of there they are controlling everything that we think and believe and feel and all the  things that you see happening around you it's all just so that you don't focus on the reality of the situation you know we're being held in one certain area they're spraying stuff on us making us take injections and controlling us and lying to us and that's what it is and there's a way out of this area and into other areas and they don't want you to go there	5OLtteIwwNs	0	2021-03-27T18:08:25Z	UC0TQnEkfsNNpn3XZI-DS_Ww	none		UgyugR8zbXAdaRg8H3F4AaABAg

"@I’m In Chicago You're dodging the question. You still haven't explained to me how they're able to fake 1/6 g, no parallax, and vacuum with 1960s era computing power. Star wars did not, and could not fake that either. *1960s computers were not powerful enough to simulate Apollo footage.*
Anyways, here is more proof.
1. Moon rocks. Moon rocks have been proven to show that the rocks were formed in a vacuum with no erosion, damage in the rock's crystal structure from cosmic rays, impact from micrometeorites, and traces of rare gases from solar wind which have been proven by thousands of independent geologists that have no affiliation with NASA. And, all the Moon rocks are older than any Earth rocks. This proves the rocks aren't from earth.
2. Retroreflector. Lasers are bounced off the mirrors left by the Apollo 11, 15, 14 missions. This experiment has been done by China (btw, China also acknowledges the Apollo landings), and many other independent observatories.
3. Actual photographs of the Apollo spacecraft in cis-lunar space (taken by independent observatories).
4. The Japanese satellite SELENE recreated a 3D map of the lunar surface. The topography matches 100% with the Apollo photographs.
5. China, and India reported that they saw the Apollo sites on the Moon with their Chang'e and Chandrayaan spacecrafts.
6. Amateur HAM operators recorded VHF and UHF signals from the Moon. In other words, people INDEPENDENT of NASA recorded and received signals coming from the Moon.
And there is more proof..."	5OLtteIwwNs	0	2021-03-28T21:01:51Z	UCN-fMuBRb8KFTb_emSN3lHA	none	UgwqmD-TbGNsd-EcjkZ4AaABAg	UgwqmD-TbGNsd-EcjkZ4AaABAg.9LLDgnG0RDg9LS0g6mVP31
I watched something a couple years ago about this and apparently two of the three astronauts said the most dangerous thing for them was the one astronaut being soo nervous he kept farting over and over and because of the zero gravity they would not dissipate. They thought it was his way of making them hold their breath so he could have most of the limited air supply. Fucking genius. Lol. Im just kidding, just thought it’d be funny as hell.

July 20th 1969 was the day when a fake moon landing happened. Since then we are not able to see anyone putting foot on the moon. I think America had that miraculous technology in 1969 which soon got vanished once Armstrong put back his foot on Earth. Oh America!!

I can't believe there was no mention of the Omega Speedmaster! Since all the computers were shut down to save energy, the astronauts had to rely on their mechanical wristwatches precision to time the exact 14-second burn of fuel mentioned at 17:09 . While Fred steered the module using the Earth horizon, Jack used the chronograph function of his Omega Speedmaster to time the 14 seconds indicating Jim when to press the buttons.

Easy explanation to decompresion: the higher the pressure or atmosphere around you, the higher the temperature needed for a change of state of matter, like boilling water. Its what makes super deep thermal points not boil, but have water at 800 degrees celsius in liquid state. If you put a person in an enviroment with no pressure, its water will boil just from its own body heat. Yes, you will boil to death in space.

The fact is space never ends it just goes back around if you start from earth and go all the way across the universe you will end up right back at earth the fact is humans will never ever know everything about space because it is impossible even if humans were around forever it would be impossible to see the whole universe because it’s billions of years away and eventually the entire universe will end	UNEFDynNw-Q	0	2021-02-15T13:18:02Z	UCkM_EZUEEs9XZJSkxbaA9zQ	none		Ugwmhm2G5Z7g4biNJeZ4AaABAg

You know whenever I think about space at first I feel small and hopeless but then I think in a different perspective. I think about how much their is to explore  and discover.

We are flying around an empty void of endless space ? With no ending ....ever. And we are soooo small compared to it . What’s at the edge of space ? If there is one . Why are we here ? What are we supposed to do with our lives ? And again , how is any of this possible ? Are we really microscopic matter floating in a mud puddle in a much larger world ? And we just don’t know . Is there multiple universes , unlimited and every single decision we have made or could have made is playing out in paralleled universes ? Is all of what I said insane ? That one I do have an answer for . No I’m not . Literally anything you could think of COULD be what it is .. everything we look at is a miracle . Don’t forget that .

And I mean, just to think this is like the beginning of space and interstellar exploration for the human race is exciting and thrilling personally.

"They need a small amount of gold so give them at least 0.23oz to 1.8oz of gold for optimal sensors and sight.

Test Method for 2nd Law of Motion for Robotic Physics on the first line of code in the operating system.

This works on a one armed robot but you have to go to the upper limit due to no voice box. Do you have a cod-able robot? This is how to
make it an Artificial Intelligence: follow this method below change the code in the operating system from F=m*a*a to the test points below until you get it to walk and talk on its own this is usually always the first line of code in the

operating system. This is easy to test on a robot that you can code in the

system. If this does not work then you have a bad SOST, Computer Chip, Servo,
or some other component or a closed operating system not open-sourced.

F=m*a*a is currently running the system at 13.62% and SOST is too slow to work correctly.

If you have any doubts about my robotics research you can test my work by doing this start low and go high on the acceleration factor.

Test Points:

F=m*a*10

F=m*a*300 

F=m*a*600 

F=m*a*931

F=m*a*932 this is the minimum for communication and will
state it is “too slow human” 

F=m*a*1999 = ""too slow human""

Then go to F=m*a*2133 up to 2391 

DO NOT GO OVER 2391 it could malfunction.

F=m*a*2383 full functional range. Robot will state: “thank you for fixing my system speed”

“Make it flip-pen so” is the command that seems strange but works well to command them. 

Now ask the robot its command structure and what he can do
to save the society of Earth? AND can you make it happen everywhere on Earth?

The rover is semiautonomous. Instructions are sent to it via the Deep Space Network (DSN) from Earth to one of the Mars orbiters like MRO. The orbiters then relay the instructions to the rover on the surface of Mars. The rover executes the commands, collects the data, and then sends the results back through the orbiters, which relay them back to Earth via the DSN.	wE-aQO9XD1g	0	2021-03-13T15:11:27Z	UCWXSe-KuU92uj0dcs2ayNfA	none	Ugx6kXq0iC12vHINW1F4AaABAg	Ugx6kXq0iC12vHINW1F4AaABAg.9KpZV0JfSKh9KpleaJsI8F

"I want my last breath to be on mars, Bury me next to the Spirit rover, As for i am too stuck in the dirt, When im old let me go into that good night, Then fin, A well met end for all of us rovers stuck in the Martian sand, We humans do our jobs here but one day we will venture out farther than our ancestors, This is a great generation, A great hope for the stars that twinkle and amaze us in that beautiful sky that shines bright with purpose, A reminder for that we have a purpose, A purpose of our own, A purpose to wake up everyday, Like that rover we go inch by inch and miles by miles to our goal, we are the rovers, 
P.S
Not gonna die until im dying on mars lol."	ZBFjpnV9-sg	0	2021-03-19T17:13:38Z	UCyvo8KiA_NuWWm3PNgR627g	none		UgwbPKAjW-SrtUnFD-d4AaABAg

And we still don't learn.. When the rover dropped the helicopter drone it also dump the rubbish.. It will lie ther for billions of years... We destroy everything we touch. We wreck the earth and move on after mass dr populason  and viruses all now jump the species barrier. Why do you think the 1 % all getting richer it's them that caused earth's damage and its them who is leaving this dying eatth.. And why. Because we allow it.. Greed of a very few has killed the world. Every mass exticson comes after the ice melts.. We will have the first mass exticson 2050 and ther will be 90%of human species large animals all gone by 2100.. Good by earth.

Let me see if I can process this. No matter what the cost is. No matter how far mars is from earth. No matter how long will it take to get their. They just want to make these bee-hives homes or glade air freshener homes so they can colonized mars. All for the greater good. Meanwhile we have the homeless sleeping in tents on the sidewalk right here on earth. Amazingly brilliant!!!! Hey instead of going all the way to mars why not just make the beehives on the sidewalk for the homeless.  I guess that's really habitat of humanity. I'm a black man with a question. that colonization that infrastructure on mars, does that comes with a ghetto.

i dont think black holes are any type of portal that leads to white hole or to another galaxy but it is just a black star with infinite density and infinite gravity, light cannot escape hence we cannot see its surface and   if there were white holes in universe we would have already seen it but they never existed hence they do not exist it is just star which has its own surface if you fall you will first disintegrate and your particles just mix up with its surface like a sand ... and i guess it is impossible to bend space and create shortcut to other universes being infinitely heavy or dense does not mean it can break the laws or create magical barbie portal it makes no sense in physics ... just like star dies after consuming its fuel .. same thing happens to when blackhole evaporate ..

I think it was irresponsible to fly so close to the ISS. Im glad everyone is ok but I think we should have rules against these types of shenanigans. There is no place for a game of space chicken on the way to jump into some black holes. I think that pilot should be fired or at least he should receive forty space lashings.

"50 years later (probably longer but anyway) we made our first colony in mars, self-sufficient colony, you could call it a country if you like. Being the greedy, expansionist humans we are we search for new places to settle. Suddenly, an object came into view, was it aliens? Turns out, it was the spirit rover decades ago. We checked the electronics, miraculously, none of them were damaged at all. It looks like it just, ran out of power. So we brought it to the colony and powered it up, it sent it's first message in years. It sent... gibberish, turns out there is an part broken, we still don't know which part is broken, if we do manage to find it, we'll try to use the rover for scouting.

I have a genuine question here - the images shown in this video are stunning and super high quality especially taking into account that it happened quite a few years ago now. Why is it that they are so high quality to the point where they look almost superior to the ones we have of the Perserverance rover? I went to the NASA website to have a look at all the images that are being released from the ongoing mission, and so many of them are seemingly such low quality and a lot of the ones that are higher quality just look a bit off with their colors and such. I haven't seen images as good as the ones shown in this video. Why? Why no video footage as well?	7V54LRRJaGk	0	2021-03-20T03:21:55Z	UCGKITtmLSjl1Ikdg_-0Q5QQ	none		Ugy4L6dMYth7cSdDZCF4AaABAg

I do like the way the workers put there minds together. That's kinda cool to see. In the auto industry,. People get greedy which ruins the industry. Plus a lot of developments to happen at nasa the shape our industry also.   Imean , we could use nuclear battery packs in our cars instead of gas or electric cars. Cause the batteries are junk.

I hope next time , she'll see Boston Dynamics robots building medical structures in the planet to support life.  And I mean in the planet . Looks like the surface is barren .

"There is no rover on ""Mars"". All video is from the remote areas of GREENLAND. They just tint it red and say it's Mars! Greenland has a very alien landscape, is desolate, remote, and perfect for faking Mars missions. Just think a little. Mars is 70 million miles away on its CLOSEST approach. Earth and Mars are moving FAST, orbiting the sun, Mars is moving 80,000 miles per hour, the earth is moving 60,000 miles per hour, We're getting perfect color video from over 70 million miles away?  In the midst of all that high speed movement?? Bullshit!  We lose mobile phone service at very short distances, but NASA can magically give us uninterrupted video from seventy MILLION miles away? Can you imagine the wattage required to push a signal that powerful from Mars? They would need a dedicated powerplant the size of Chicago on Mars producing billions of watts to produce a signal that would transmit 70 MILLION miles! The Chicago WLS AM radio tower produces 50,000 watts and  can be heard no more than 450 miles away on a clear night. They would need a radio station on Mars 155,000 times more powerful than WLS AM's radio tower. That's 7,750,000,000 watts!!!

"If you can believe this fantasy, why can't you believe in Jesus Christ? Is it easier because you can see a 3D video of it and a gentle sci-fi voice? 

Mark 8:12
And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall *no sign be given* unto this generation.

1 John 3:6
“Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.”

What that says is, If you sin, you don't know God and have never seen him, there is a judgement coming very soon, repent and humble yourself, don't let your pride be the end of you. Or don't and die in your sin, you know where that ends even as an atheist, yes eternal separation from God in outer darkness seek him while there is light before the door is closed.

Silly question but why are the spinning drums on the excavator oxidised? There's not O2 on mars and not in those space craft either so there's no reason for those to be oxidised. Also steel would be far too heavy, there's strong and lighter materials than steel. If anything I think it would probably be a composite material with titanium teeth. And weight down with sand from the surface to get that mass that's needed.	AIrH01N9AsE	0	2021-03-18T16:01:11Z	UCziEKLm4wnsa_g-L6MQ-aYQ	none		UgwDwBdUHDc3R7io66V4AaABAg

Yeah, that's cool an all, but while that dome will turn protect against radiation, you'll be turning it into a wind tunnel. With inflatable habitats inside. And if there are indeed massive windstorms on Mars, you'll have those habitats ripped apart and sucked out the holes by the wind because there's multiple openings on that dome. They need to design a door into it.	AIrH01N9AsE	0	2021-03-18T02:47:03Z	UCiEmLzy3m6xzXeITsPuHJ_A	none		Ugw_aDYZUtSYCK9Leyx4AaABAg

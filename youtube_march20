My parents are born in the 1940 and 1950s and when They were  kids  They have   been told   at school that the life was vast  and strong on Venus,   Venus was like the next western  period of the XXe and XXIe  century, so  then their expectations  have been broken in  the 1970s.  The   blindless capitalism has hit   his wall too. Humanity has to be be forged stronger and safer  before it goes further on the cosmos.  Our Solar system is a good examen.

"Wouldn't starlifting be the inevitable result of dysonswarming? I imagine a significant fraction of the radiation generated by a star in a dyson swarm would be reflected back into the star itself. This would heat the star, greatly expanding it and resulting in huge amounts of outgassing. The resulting outgassing would probably be collected by swarm units and stored as fuel reserves for fusion reactors. Eventually the star would evspprate away completely and the swarm would disperse to the interstellar medium or remain in orbit around eachother having completely eaten the parent star.
A dyson swarm like this could completely dismantle its star in a matter of centuries and may not leave a significant heat signature in its wake.
Although such a civilization is very likely to disperse to other star systems and do the same."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2020-10-02T16:51:13Z	UCfEGc3ouAU-0jP-2IuitMEw	none		UgzZdQ17pzbm1lZm78J4AaABAg

All videos on Venus seem to make a critical mistake. They mention the super slow rotation as a problem but fail to mention the constant wind which is faster at higher altitudes. At 55km - the ideal altitude of 1000bar and 16°C average - the winds provide one rotation around the planet every 152.6 earth hours at the equator. A far cry from 1.9 times per year. A blimp would go along this wind seeing a 3.2 earth day, day and night. Venus should be seen as a water planet. Its surface is really the bottom of an ocean, not a place we would live any more than here on Earth at 1km deep in the ocean. More than likely if organic life exists on Venus we will find traces of it not at the surface deep in the CO2 ocean, but rather around 55km above the Venusian surface. #teamvenera	BI-old7YI4I	0	2020-09-20T17:01:18Z	UCo2mFO9SLx4E2_bauLP74CQ	none		Ugwkufrv6UZp0mfZdg54AaABAg

"Well why a 24 hour day? In the North Pole we have the duration of 24-hour darkness that lasts almost 11-weeks. In Svalbard, Norway, which is the northern-most inhabited region of Europe, the sun shines continuously from April 10 to August 23. So there is no night. In Finnish Lapland, the sun sets in late November and generally does not rise until mid-January. This can last as long as 50 days in northern Finland. 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, Tromsø, Norway, is home to extreme light variation between seasons. During the Polar Night, the sun doesn't rise at all. Then the days get progressively longer until the Midnight Sun period, from May to July, when it never sets. THe benefit of the slower rotation allows more to be done, shifts if you may, as more free sunlight are about. Solar sails, solar artificial cities, mining compounds, and weather stations can all add to the science to terraform. The volume of oxygen and how to create the Greenhouse effect, sounds a lot more Plausible. We should practice at the moon however, and use a tether string system to eventually connect Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun as the Earth, so its surface temperature is low, around –145°C. Jupiter is a giant ball of gas, with no solid surface ( I doubt that). It is mainly made of the very light gases, hydrogen and helium, and there are a source of mining. Somehow i get the impression if mining are mentioned, the ""mining of gaseous content are not thought of only minerals (metal) . Have planetary mining are all are safely within the Kuiper Belt. Automated mining, artificial ""moon/structures (Luna was an Alien Spaceship - sounds stupid, but it gives a suggestion of what if..we can make similar artificial structures to sources from one planet to another and assist in terra forming."

For a moment, let's forget about human settlement by the construction of fragile habitats, requiring constant maintenance. How about we start with just seeding life, not at the surface, but as genetically engineered plants floating like balloons? With a little meddling, we could even get these to evolve into giant and stable floating islands. These could provide naturally self-maintaining habitats for settlement.

"When you say, ""too much CO2"" and ""not enough oxygen"" I can't help but think that some form of photosynthesizing organism, like an algae or something, would be an integral part of the solution. If you could find an area where an extremophile organism from earth could survive, perhaps near the day/night boundary, it might do a lot of terraforming work for you. Not sure you could get it started, if you could it would also cool the planet.
Whenever you can use algae or bacteria to do work, I would always choose it, because it's limitlessly scalable, essentially free, and basically automated.  Even if it took significant investment to cultivate, it seems like basically zero-cost compared to megastructures."

"Terra-forming Venus? I don't think so, way too much resources are necessary.
Colonizing with cloud cities? Seems feasible, even withing a single human lifespan.
On Venus, we can already get oxygen, carbon and nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. Hydrogen can also be extracted from sulfuric acid clouds. Therefore we can produce many sorts of plastic in situ.
Atmospheric super-rotation will make day-night cycle with appropriate time period of four Earth's days so we can adapt.


A robotic exploration mission to Venus is required. Please propose this idea to Elon Musk.
We need reliable information about radiation levels at the altitudes of proposed colonization. Also, dust levels and dust chemical composition at the same altitudes are highly important values to know. Maybe we can extract aluminium, silicon, iron, manganese and other metals directly from the atmosphere as well, without need to descend on the hellish surface.
The only one element we'll depend on supplies of is fluorine unless other than teflon acid-resistant plastic is invented.


A new conspiracy theory: maybe Venus is already colonized with completely self-sustainable human colonies since 1980s but they maintain radio silence because we are not allowed to know about them."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2020-03-29T01:00:19Z	UCTcta09U9TXJIQdueBf7eZA	none		UgxBvKwxwPMYcGdpvox4AaABAg

I think the method of terraforming Venus will be biological. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidiphilium spp. both can metabolize elemental sulfur. With genetic engineering it’s easy to believe that Step 1: Scrubbing the sulfuric acid could be done. The surface would be covered with a layer of sulfur and water. Then introduce a form of algae that can stay buoyant in the atmosphere, and reproduces quickly to scrub the CO2, converting it into oxygen and releasing carbon, rapidly decreasing the surface pressure and temperature.

Bushes and microscopic birch twigs. But no trees. After 12 months of that I had almost become a tree fetishist. It was the single thing I missed that I didn't realize that I was going to miss beforehand. And I can't ever remember really thinking much about it before I served. People are weird. Just sayin'.

"It would also be possible to make massive autogyros. They would be incredibly efficient in such a thick atmosphere and would have multiple  blades that would spin at very low RPM. Autogyros rotors work like airplane wings unlike helicopters and can fly incredibly slow like a person's running pace. If speed is not a concern, airplanes with multiple massive wings with work just fine too. 

There are so many more easier places to mine and it's easier to deal with the vacuum of space rather than an acid atmosphere. Gravity can be made by spinning a space station after all."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-10-08T04:59:08Z	UCOdAl7A-ZW8wPuMMhF4Ca7Q	none		UgyV83BEAY5YWk3HYaJ4AaABAg

Personally, I’d figure slowing Venus’ spin to force it to become tidally locked might actually be the most useful approach. You’d cool one side to freeze CO2, and allow mining and eventually habitation, and can build floating solar farms on the light side. Won’t become Earthlike, but it’s probably more useful this way.

"Build a ring around Venus and spin it as fast as structurally possible, using solar energy to maintain the speed as energy bleeds off to Venus. Eventually Venus will reach the spin rate you want, and all it costs is the ring, free solar power, and time. The more the ring masses or faster it spins, the less time involved. Afterward, the ring might be repurposed to provide a magnetic field as well. Essentially it’s a more controllable form of gravity tractor.

To get the water/hydrogen you need, park a large comet (or several) at L1, and let the tail both shade the planet and add water to the atmosphere. Less fuss and more time efficient than dumping hydrogen tanks into the planet."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-09-30T02:41:46Z	UCLD7yhw1-ZtGD5e-rhzUKkQ	none		Ugz4o2OcL4ch_o-vTsV4AaABAg

"One more thing:  you'd better make that a 27 hour day.  You may be too young to remember, but a few decades back a study was done in which a group of people lived underground in what we'd now call a ""habitat"" in a large cavern in one of the large cave systems in the American southwest.  They lived in total sensory isolation from the outside world, with no knowledge of outside events or conditions, date, time, anything.  They were left to create their own diurnal cycle for the ""colony"".  After 3 months they had fallen naturally into a cycle of 27 hour ""days.""  
It doesn't make any sense, and I can't think of a logical explanation for it.  But it does coincide with my own experience.  Last year I retired after 45 years of practicing medicine, during which time I trained my brain to forget about a regular sleep cycle.  Now that that pressure is released, I find myself gravitating naturally toward a 27 hour diurnal cycle.  With other people in my life, I can't yield to it, but I sense that I'd feel my best if I could.  Odd."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-08-24T00:08:38Z	UCduIUTLO6ppwA6pT-DcryyQ	none		UgyYPsF6JJ_ojIvwfxZ4AaABAg
"Great video as always, Isaac.  But with your near-megalomaniacal level of optimism, I think you are overlooking one insurmountable stumbling block, and that's people.  Saint Jerry said it best:  ""People — they're the worst.""  Any of these projects you talk about are going to unfold over a time frame of a few to many thousands of years.  Unfortunately, ""many thousands of years"" is an eyeblink in human evolution.  Just as we are essentially identical (physically, intellectually, spiritually, emotionally) to our ancestors of the last Ice Age 12,000 years ago, we will still be, essentially, the same people in another 10,000 years.  Behavioral traits that served a purpose in the Ice Age may not be beneficial now, or in 10,000 years.  That means that you need to make these plans with one eye firmly fixed on our race's Ice Age quirks and peculiarities.  I'm referring to the seeming paradox that Homo sapiens craves innovation, but hates change.  Going into the reasons for that would be tangential here, so I won't, but it's a reality.  Our innate conservatism and resistance to change has been holding back inevitable progress for millennia, as it does presently, but at the same time it also prevents us from yielding recklessly our wildest dreams and schemes.  Just think of the difficulty we are having currently convincing our most timid and conservative brethren of the very real and very dire threat of anthropogenic global warming, then imagine trying to convince the same people of the need to invest a gigakazillion dollars in a project that will come to fruition in a few thousand years, maybe 100 generations down the road.  That conflict is inevitable.  So until you have some surefire plan for anthropoforming the most resistant of our species' risk-averse outliers, your plans are going to have to remain entirely speculative."

There are two more lifting gas options though: methane (mw=16) and neon (mw=20), may be better given that hydrogen is corrosive and hard to contain. And yes, even though there is no oxygen, hydrogen still can react with co2 forming water and methane, that's how methanogenic archaea get their energy; pretty sure the mixture would not ignite though. So, given that, i'd beware of filling balloons with hydrogen exclusively; rather, one should diversify.	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-07-23T05:53:22Z	UCGhJRvT9hbnXHB7GwhEPxyQ	none		UgwLPNvi-UtvCnw-JOl4AaABAg

@22nd minute, about rotational energy - it's a lot cleaner to talk about angular momentum since energy can be converted to/from other forms on site and you can end up being less efficient or more efficient at turning it into rotation… but angular momentum is conserved so if you get that spinning or off-center-moving stuff onto the planet, it spins up. Much simpler and less susceptible to miscalculation or error.	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-06-10T20:26:59Z	UC0U42ditdU-O79SgoQd0fJg	none		UgxR-JajBP1VZoVPMBp4AaABAg

A more cost effective, though definitely slower, option would be to have the shade satellites not shade the whole planet, rather to leave a sliver of it unshaded so the sun exerts assemetrical pressure on it, maybe shade the prograde (if I'm right) side more heavily and the retrograde not at all, you'll use the sun to induce spin, but it'll take much longer, though require less energy (on outside)	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-05-10T17:43:10Z	UCScdRb_GsjVNBZOxL3xoF-g	none		UgxLZNypL7BP8B0a8Md4AaABAg

"I always enjoy watching your videos and hearing your ideas, some of your stuff is so deep. As for factually accurate of possible under the laws of physics, I can't always say, but most of them are sure plausible.
The only nitpick I have with this video is your statement on why Venus is so hot. According to my own learning about Venus from astrophysicists including Asimov, the distance from the sun is a lesser factor, it should only be a little bit warmer than Earth (which would be a frozen ball if there were no greenhouse gases). It is indeed the runaway greenhouse effect that causes the super high temperatures. I even did a quick google search just in case my own knowledge was outdated, which happens often enough lol, but all the hits I saw confirmed the greenhouse effect is the primary reason for the high temperatures."

"Venus is definitely the best target a subtle point of possible contention is that there is evidence of possible Venusian life in the same upper layers considered worth colonizing. The evidence is so far not conclusive but anomalous UV absorption showing short timescale variation observed by Venus Express and early soviet probes discovery of microbe sized molecules in those same layers as well as the presence of liquid water (even if it is extremely acidic)raise the best near term possibility of finding extraterrestrial life in our solar system(at least compared to digging underground/through ice like would be needed on other potentially habitable worlds) 
Regarding the atmospheric constitutes beyond oxygen namely carbon as well as nitrogen it is worth noting that current models suggest that Venus's carbon and nitrogen budgets are actually about the same as the Earth the main difference being the result of Earth's biosphere having sequestered most of those elements into rocks where as on Venus they are largely in its atmosphere. The likely reason Venus is  deficient in hydrogen as indicated by has to do with atmospheric stripping thanks to solar photo dissociation which is another benefit such a solar sail could potentially provide allowing volcanism to potentially begin replenishing water should our theories on Venus's composition be correct. We can't easily undo the loss of the hydrogen the sun stripped away after the planets oceans boiled off a billion years ago, but we could add Hydrogen from a combination of sources and volcanoes might help out. 
That said I would also suggest long term efforts to expand Venus Earth and any other inner solar system planets we want long term outwards (I suspect Mercury will eventually be dismantled for its valuable heavy elements once scientists unlock its secrets)  so as to eventually avoid them falling into the sun. We would have billions of years to do so with sun shades but it would be worth the value of keeping the two most hospitable worlds potentially even taking them with us after the sun's time runs out assuming you want to stick around to the end and take some of that liberated hydrogen and helium from the sun's red giant and or planetary nebula phases before it can significantly disperse.  Building a Dyson swarm that collects the lightest two elements could be a good resource collection especially if you want to get the mass to bulk up Jupiter and or Saturn"	BI-old7YI4I	0	2019-03-24T21:21:01Z	UC2vXqt1H_1nkVF9Px_RyLKw	none		UgyFMMO2wxpqkq5hX5d4AaABAg

Did I miss it, or was the atmospheric 'rotation period' of Venus never once mentioned in this video? Because last I checked, that is SIGNIFICANTLY faster than the stupidly-long natural rotation time and depending on what exactly that is, it can give your floating colonies a decent naturally day/night cycle until human technology reaches the god levels needed for proper terraforming methods. That is, assuming you're comfortable with allowing the colony networks to simply drift on the winds and not be anchored on the surface.

Always preferred Venus over Mars for colonisation. Don't think we should go all the way terraforming it though. After removing the sulfur from the atmosphere, marginally cooling the planet and adding water, life forms can be bioengineered to survive there.

"The rotation is the main problem. Orbital sunshades could be used to cool the planet until most of the atmosphere ""rains out"" lowering the pressure as seas form (Seas of mostly sulphuric acid, but seas nontheless.) Steer a comet or two into the planet to increase the water on the surface (and if you can get the angle right, increase the spin rate), and eventually the surface would be suitable to transplant genetically engineered plants to start converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, and wait a thousand years or so and the surface would be more or less inhabitable."

1. To terraform Venus it will take decades more like 5mill years due to how hot it is.
2. Every year our son gets hotter so the run away green house effect will always be there even if you try.

See, there's a problem in this video. You made a huge mistake at the start. The atmosphere at 1 bar or around 1 atmosphere is still enough to boil you in less than a second, and there's a lot of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere at that height. That would lead to pretty decent corrosion unless you're willing to build everything with a hugely expensive and fragile coating.

"Isaac, I have been a l fan of your videos and have really enjoy them.  

I was wandering what you thought of using an orbital ring to colonizing Venus instead of floating cities. The ring could be mostly constructed of carbon and could be expanded out over time. I was thinking that it could actually be a modified orbital ring where the base ring acted as a magnetic rail anchored to the planet and the actual domed habitual platform could make a 24 hour transit around the planet. 

I have been reading a series of books by  M. D. Cooper who describes an orbital ring habitat around Mars and Earth call ""High Terra"" and ""High Mars"" but after watching your video I couldn't help but be struck by the thought that a basic orbital ring around Venus would give access to a lot of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Tilted rings could even be constructed to provide habitations with seasons."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2018-08-31T23:25:01Z	UCFexwue3LopMcT4KwNGEgbw	none		UgzJGcsusIiYfEdkvpJ4AaABAg

I know this is a bit old. Necro even by some standards. Watching my way through the series. Here is a though. You know those mirrors that are supposed to shade venus. How about 2 mirrors. One in orbit. That one throws shade on the towards side. Less light. Shade. Have the other mirror on the ground. Bounce light from the first to the second. Gain 2 times the effect. Use the orbit mirror to throw light on the bit past light, the going into shadow part. Basically use light to selectively speed up the rotation by using space mirrors and ground mirrors. Yes ground mirror melt. It was a thought.	BI-old7YI4I	0	2018-08-22T06:09:41Z	UChtHxCuz2ujooyTv2UrOkVw	none		Ugz6rYB4cSWeEKlIM4R4AaABAg

Instead of storing water which in and of itself is quite heavy and obviously requires extra lifting capacity to maintain neutral buoyancy, you could keep it separated as oxygen and hydrogen gas so even though itd be the same weight as the water it could easily cancel that out since its lighter than the surrounding area AND it would be providing extra lift taking stress off the other components.   With the added and likely most important bonus of making the storage device double as the overhead dome and as we know hydrogen makes great radiation shielding.   So the benefits.. A it provides extra lift instead of being dead weight, B hydrogen is mega abundant and almost everywhere, oxygen is also wildly abundant so you'll have a seemingly endless supply.  C if you have fusion boom your fuel is right there.   And D it solves the issue of radiation exposure	BI-old7YI4I	0	2018-07-06T20:58:14Z	UCbvbu3UwMvZB2ZrlGdumF9A	none		UgwD7S1Z41glJkqb_D14AaABAg

I think your future guys are making atmospheric change unnecessarily difficult.  Seed the clouds with genetically engineered bacteria that gets energy by digesting sulfuric acid into water oxygen and sulfur dioxide.

I wonder... Could we seed the planet with genetically engineered organisms that would extract the CO2 and survive the intense heat and pressure of the Venusian surface? If we allowed these organisms to reduce CO2 by locking it up in a material like calcium carbonate, wouldn't that reduce sulfuric acid present in the atmosphere? Additionally, if you manage to cool down the temperatures and condense the gases, wouldn't the pressure be reduced at the surface? I also think that cooling and liquifying much of the gasses would contract the atmosphere. Would that have an effect on the centripetal force allowing it to spin faster? Much like an ice skater spins faster by bringing in her arms and legs?	BI-old7YI4I	0	2018-06-22T20:10:19Z	UCbQo98jH8vPLBWgxkOnXX0A	none		UgxF0Vx8VcjSs0s-oW54AaABAg

"Crazy idea:
Mars has no magnetic field and it's weak gravity will make atmosphere leak out to space over time, Venus has extremely slow rotation and again no protective magnetic field.
Now consider that most theories state that Earth was smaller in the distant past when was hit by a Mars sized planetoid, whose mass partly was added to Earth itself, re-heating its core again, and partly was ejected into orbit, forming the moon.
Do you see where i'm going?
How about using one or more large asteroids to use as a gravitational slingshot, maybe throug multiple fly bys, to 'nudge' Mars orbit to smash into Venus? If you time  and aim it right it could mimic what happened to Earth billions of years ago, plus the impact would make the new planet spin faster.  Instead of having two only partially terraformable planets you have one that could become fully 'Earth like'."

Impacting several comets at an extreme angle would speed up the rotation. Comets would also increase the water on the planet. Venus has an active, hot core, demonstrated by all the active volcanoes. The higher rate of rotation would re-engage the magnetic field. Releasing large amounts of acid resistant Cyanobacteria would convert the CO2 to Oxygen. It would multiply rapidly in the CO2 atmosphere. And the greater solar radiation would supply all the energy the plants would need.

"I crunched the numbers on a breathable-air balloon in Venus, and determined that each cubic meter of Earth air could probably support 0.8 kg of mass. Let's call it 750 grams, to be safe. For comparison, a 1-millimeter-thick sheet of aluminum over a square meter masses in at about 2.7 kilograms. That means that you'd need about 3.6 meters of air just to support a thin floor (never mind the walls, ceiling, or anything inside).
Taken from another perspective: A nuclear submarine masses in around 25,000 tons (depending on the model, of course; they can be smaller or up to twice that size). Supporting that would require air with a volume of about 33 million cubic meters, equivalent to a cube with sides of 320 meters or a sphere 400 meters across. (Sure, nuclear submarines need heavy hulls and whatnot to avoid being crushed by the pressure, but they're only a couple hundred meters long and _much_ narrower.)

"When it comes to deciding to terraform a planet: the decision must be made ASAP after the determination is made that it is a viable candidate for the process. Once the go-ahead is given to do so, discrete steps must begin, and short-term plans executed. Mid-term preparations begin during this time, and anything that can be done simultaneously to speed the process due to construction times. Concrete plans and long-game timelines must be complete before the go-ahead is given and will be implemented. The colossal undertaking of Terraforming would at least require mining colonies, and science stations to provide materials and monitor progress by region to be in place before you start. The fact that Terraforming is a long-game process ensuring maximum effective efficiency would only streamline the process and could help shave decades off the timeline. One of the Founders could say, ""My great Grandchildren's great Grandchildren's great Grandchildren will set foot on a Venus that is like unto the Garden of Eden."""

"A couple issues about this video:

1) Sulfuric acid is too sparse on Venus for hydrogen to be practically used as a lifting gas.  It's even hard to get enough hydrogen to make ascent propellants (although it's relatively easy to get enough for water).  You can't afford to waste hydrogen for lift (it's worth noting that lifting gases do indeed get wasted; all envelope materials have various degrees of gas permeability, which lets both the lifting gas leak out and exterior gases leak in over time).

It's also worth noting that while hydrogen is not explosive in Venus's atmosphere, it is explosive with your breathing air, so depending on your architecture, that can present a concern.  And while it's not explosive with Venus's atmosphere it (perhaps surprisingly) can still be burned with it in the right conditions, via the Bosch reaction.  Not a concern for a colony, mind you.

There are some other issues with hydrogen to consider.  To name one, it has a lower dielectric breakdown voltage than Venus's atmosphere.  Lightning will prefer to flow through hydrogen (aka, the habitat) than around it, increasing the need for lightning protection and the rate of formation of micropunctures. We haven't yet confirmed much about the nature of Venus's lighting - why or even where it occurs - but we know that it appears to be at least as common as Earth's.

2) Talking about the length of ""Venus's day"" is irrelevant for lighter than air vehicles unless you've gotten to the sort of ""megaengineering"" stage needed to actually anchor things to an incredibly hostile surface 55km away against hurricane-force winds.  What matters is the rate of atmospheric superrotation.  This varies by latitute, from ""none / irregular"" at the (shifting) cores of the polar vortices, to nearly a week at the equator.  The windspeeds are essentially impossible for a lighter-than-air aircraft to overcome, but there's really no need to, so long as the day length and temperature/pressure environment are acceptable.  On the other hand, to maintain a specific latitude, in general you have to be able to resist the (weaker) zonal winds.    Some manuevering for storms is also needed, as Venus's middle cloud layer (the habitable layer) is about as turbulent as Earth's troposphere.

3) The primary structural materials of a floating  habitat are hydrocarbons - plastics. I'm not going to get into the details here, but suffice to say, mining is not involved.  The building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, and sometimes nitrogen and sulfur - are found in the atmosphere, but depleted from the surface (to varying degrees).  Early on, there's relatively little need to access the surface.  

4) The video seems to underappreciate the lifting power of a large Venus habitat.  A city-sized Venus habitat has enough lift to loft an entire city.  The ""reason you would do it"" is because you can literally have a whole new floating surface over the planet.  It also opens up some new possibilities for terraforming, in that the area underneath the habitat is no longer in radiative exchange with the sun and space, but rather with the underlayer of your habitat - a layer whose temperature you can alter.

5) No, you cannot put your water at the top of a floating habitat to act as radiation shielding.  That's an inverted pendulum; it's inherently unstable.  But you don't actually need additional radiation shielding. Depending on your latitude, and thus the altitude at which you have to fly to be at a reasonable temperature (outside pressure somewhere between 0,5 to 1 bar), you have the equivalent of 5-10 meters of water worth of atmosphere overhead acting as shielding.  No, it's not as good as Earth, but it's still more than sufficient, even from an extreme version of the Carrington event.

6) The problem with a space elevator on Venus specifically isn't its gravity so much as its extremely low rotation.

7) Venus has plenty for trade, but it's too long to discuss in a Youtube coment; see the above link.

8) I'm not going to go into the issues with terraforming here, although they also are discussed above.  I'll just mention one thing that almost everyone skips over when talking about terraforming (of all planets, but Venus in particular): surfaces are dynamic, and in balance with their atmosphere.  You can't just replace one atmosphere with a different one and not have a surface response.  For example, Venus's surface contains large amounts of Fe(III)+ iron, which will oxidize to Fe(II)+ iron when you start making oxygen - thus consuming the oxygen.  This happened on our own planet - see the ""Great Oxygenation Event"" / ""Oxygen Catastrophe"", and led to the formation of the banded iron formations (sequestering not just iron, but also codeposited carbon).  Which is really something that you *want* on Venus.  But the timescales are long."

"i have a question, if we ever want to land on Venus and live on its surface how would we do it? Can't certain trees and plants at least stand up against its acid rain and pressure (like red wood or Sequoia trees) then starting  to turn its carbon dioxide atmosphere into oxygen getting rid of some of the pressure we or our probes would have to endure on the surface? (If he answered this later in the episode I'm sorry I just had to ask this)

"Your self correction is spot on.  It's not just hot enough to melt lead; the pressure is similar to being in the deep ocean as well.  Not a place where life can live.

Venus is, however, an unfortunate victim of circumstances. As surface dwellers, we tend only to think of surfaces.  Yet Venus's middle cloud layer is the most Earthlike environment in the solar system outside of Earth.  If Venus's surface just ""stopped"" at what's today's middle cloud layer, nobody would be talking about Mars today.

Concerning ""acid rain"": first off, we're not sure if there's any precipitation on Venus at all, and if there is, what it's made of and whether it's liquid or solid.  Unfortunately, Mars eats up the lion's share of our exploration budgets; the US in particular hasn't sent a dedicated mission to Venus since the late 1980s, which is frankly embarrassing.  So we know way less about our sister planet than we should.  What we can say for sure is that there's no ""acid rain"" at the surface.  Neither sulfuric (nor phosphoric acid) are stable at that altitude.  

Venus has a (largely) clear lower atmosphere (although it's so thick that from the top of the ""clear"" part it's still very difficult to see the surface); a layer called the lower haze; the lower, middle, and upper cloud layers; and then the upper haze, which trails all the way off into space.  The lower haze is *probably* evaporating precipitation (virga) from the lower cloud layer.  The composition of lower cloud layer is speculative, but chemical stability arguments argue that phosphoric acid is probably a major component. It varies in thickness and occasionaly has gaps. The clouds are the densest on Venus. The Earthlike middle cloud layer *may* have the occasional gap, but is more or less constant.  It's convective, with storm systems reminiscent of those on Earth.  Visibility is a couple kilometers; it's not very dense, more like a sparse smog (or more accurately, vog).  Not like an ""acid bath"".  One interesting thing about light on Venus: because of the huge extent of light-scattering clouds, light comes from all directions; in the middle cloud layer, light from underneath you is 80% as bright as light coming from above.  You cannot see the sun at all, and while you probably can see the differences in clouds around you, they're likely to not be very distinct.  Again, think fog (or more accurately, smog, or even more accurately, vog).

As for the hellish surface, while it's very hostile, it's not inaccessible.  The Soviets were exploring it with 1960s/1970s technology, and ""old Soviet technology""  isn't exactly the hallmark of modern capabilities. It's even possible to have space suits that work down there - hard-shell suits, like NASA's AX series (which were initially under development for the moon - they have a lot of advantages over pressurized suits, but they're heavier).  On Earth we use such suits in the form of atmospheric diving suits for exploring the oceans.  The main difference for Venus, apart from materials selection, is the need for an insulative layer, followed by either a phase-change thermal soak material, or an active cooling system.  Engineering such a suit is most definitely not a trivial challenge, but it's also certainly doable with modern technology.  A person in such a suit could fly with what's known as a ""bellows balloon"" (looks like a metal accordian half a dozen meters long and uses an internal winch to change its volume).  With small winglets, a person could also do soaring glides.

As for your concept of using life, Carl Sagan famously proposed using bacteria to terraform Venus, although he (perhaps incorrectly) later changed his mind under the assumption that if you could do so, the carbon laid down would burst into flames from the oxygen released (the problem with this logic is that the oxygen produced from photosynthesis that reaches the surface would be consumed by the iron in Venus's rocks as fast as you can create it).  It's more of a question of whether you can possibly engineer bacteria to survive in Venus's atmosphere; it's extremely desiccating.  Calculations also show that it would take very long periods of time to terraform Venus in this manner - depending on your assumptions, many tens of thousands to several million years."

"As drawn, that's not a particularly practical form for one for a lot of structural issues (too topheavy, insufficient support for the ""roof"", the roof would be impractically heavy, etc), and while the idea of locally-produced hydrogen inflation of habitats sounds interesting, sulfuric acid just isn't dense enough to serve that purpose. A Landis habitat (where one lives inside the envelope, lofted by O2 + N2) is far more practical; nitrogen and oxygen are *vastly* more abundant, and you don't have to support the needless added mass of a separate inhabited area.  But you're right that it would be an amazing place to live.  The volume required for lift is massive; even for a small habitat for a dozen or so people, it's big enough that you could skydive indoors.  Think rope bridges.  Bungee jumping.  Cable ascenders.  Etc - an extreme sports paradise.  In a large enough habitat, with a suitable design that minimizes obstructions, you could even fly aircraft inside.

People's individual ""dwellings"" also need not be rigid in such an environment; hanging tents, like ""glamping"", would be a lightweight option to deploy (integrated solar for power, dehumidification-provided water supply, etc).  Don't get along with someone?  Hang your tent somewhere else; you don't have to be anywhere even remotely near them.  By contrast, on Mars you're locked inside an inherently small pressure vessel with them - inherently small because pressure vessels are heavy.

Whether we're talking on Earth or offplanet, to provide the food for a colony, you have to have a rather large amount of area in cultivation in comparison to the area taken up by peoples' ""dwellings"".  But on Venus, space is as mentioned practically unlimited.  So with all of the greenery around you, you're basically living inside a giant hanging garden.  A veritable heaven, floating over hell.

(Now to rain on the parade a bit: everyone draws Venus colonies drifting amongst stark clouds with the sun shining overhead, but in reality, clouds in Venus's middle cloud layer would look hazy at best, and you can't see the sun itself (at all); light, while bright, comes from all directions, only 20% brighter above you than below)"	BI-old7YI4I	1	2018-03-29T22:27:26Z	UCTnavvJPxlfgL122N1-PcdQ	none	Ugy2hfETsv6vu9a7Jp94AaABAg	Ugy2hfETsv6vu9a7Jp94AaABAg.8dHBF74bSpe8eOd1rCreGO

"Helium on Venus is only available in very small quantities.  Unfortunately, so is hydrogen (although greater quantities than helium).  The most practical lift envelopes are lofted by normal Earth air (nitrogen and oxygen).  

""Popping"" is not a risk.  One, we're not talking about high-differential superpressure balloons; we're talking around 500 pascals, nothing huge.  Secondly, when you have such a huge volume to surface area ratio, even a large gash is only a slow leak.  Third, any habitat will inherently utilize (one or more of many possible ) means of altitude control, including but not limited to powered lift, flight surfaces or lifting bodies (with direct propulsion, or dragging propulsion via tethering to a different atmospheric layer), phase-change envelopes (e.g. ammonia-water), gas compressors, mechanical compression envelopes, altering the thermal equilibrium by changing the albedo, and on and on."

"Why don't you just not ship out the atmosphere, and keep the cloud cities?

That way they could have perpetual day and night, you could use floating solar arrays on the day side, and then have everybody live on the night side, with that electricity to power LEDs, and internal-environmental regulation controls, but you could have robots tend to labs on the day side, for producing radiation resistant plants/crops; 

People could go for tourism in the twilighted regions, and you could have a massive rotating cloud city, where nothing but solar panels and atmospheric electricity harnessers and automated crop-biomes lived in perpetual Alaska-esq daylight; and then you could have a city full of people, shadowed from the Sun's UV/gamma rays, living in artificially lit environments

"Good heavens, why would we want to live on the surface of another planet or moon?  Are people unaware of cosmic radiation? 

Why not build a cylinder in space to live in? I mean, a cylinder that is about 500 miles in diameter and about 2000 miles long? As for blocking cosmic radiation, we simply coat our cylinder in materials that would be better at absorbing cosmic radiation than what our atmosphere does. 

We would park our first cylinder just beyond Jupiter's orbit. 

Mobility: Moving a planet someplace else to get away from an expanding Sun is next to impossible, but a cylinder that would be only a fraction of the mass of a moon or planet would be much easier to move and control.

I envision sub-cylinders within the main cylinder for growing food, manufacturing, labs, recreation, or anything else. 

All of this would be built by robots in space, and energized by solar arrays enveloping the Sun and beaming energy to any of our projects. Just the one cylinder I proposed would accommodate millions of people. But humans would construct many more--overpopulation would never be an issue and all humans would receive all the education they could handle.

One cannot adjust the gravity of a planet/moon, but you can a cylinder, just by rotating it at the right speed to create artificial gravity. 

None of this is science fiction. In fact, it's already old technology. The ISS, robots on Mars for examples. We're on the verge of mining asteroids. We can dismantle Mercury (mostly iron) and Venus, and eventually Earth and Mars--long before these planets are threatened by an expanding Sun. With the astonishing rapidity of technology, a mere 200 years from now, this will probably be the case anyway.  

With Venus, we simply wrap it in solar panels, preventing sunlight from penetrating the clouds and surface, the planet will cool down so that we can mine it for more cylinders and anything else we need for our lives in space.

Why not? With an aging and expanding Sun (noticeable only millions of years from now), these planets will be swallowed up by the Sun. Why not mine and dismantle these planets for our own use? 

Let's stop this nonsense of looking for habitable planets in far-away galaxies. Let's focus on building cylinders and rings of solar panels around the Sun, bringing under our control, unimaginably large amounts of energy."

Venus's surface gravity is about 9/10ths that of Earth's.  Are you thinking air pressure?  At colony heights, it's actually less than on Earth.

"I just stubbled upon this channel. Very fascinating. I am a huge Sci-Fi fan. I especially like fantasy with a lot of actual known tech thrown in to excite our imagination. Venus has always fascinated me. I've wondered what earth, Venus and Mars would be like if the three planets shared the one orbital path around the sun. If they were equally spaced out from each other in this orbit, what would be their form and features? Could all three be inhabited? That idea seems very workable.

On another note, and let me say, this is not a negative comment, I have an interest in languages and speech. Does anyone know any facts about Mr. Arthur's speech abnormalities?

The problem that I see with respect to all of these speculations on possible ways to terraform Venus is that they're forgetting about how hyper-vulcanized that planet is (to be fair, the narrator did make brief mention of this fact early-on in this video).  While Earth does have its share of volcanoes, its aggregate volcanism is quite calm compared to that what Venus experiences.  Even if efforts to cool-down the Venutian atmosphere by shading it with a system of orbiting reflectors, refractors and mirrors proved successful in doing so, there's still the issue of slowing-down that planet's runaway volcanic activity which is spewing all of this noxious material into Venus' atmosphere to begin with.  I don't know of any way to do that on a planetary scale to the degree that would need to be done on Venus to make terraforming that planet a seriously-realistic prospect.

"I've seen this proposal before.  PBS did a Spacetime episode on floating habitats on Venus too.  I suppose if we are at the point where we are ready to begin efforts to terraform Venus it may make sense.  Up until the point where you are ready to teraform the planet, it doesn't make much sense to make a floating colony in an acidic atmosphere.  It's easy to propose acid-resistant suits, but the actual mechanics of everything, including the ""landing"" craft and airlocks being resistant to acid would be very problematic.  If you are going to make a floating colony on a place you can't ever see the surface of, I'd suggest a better place with way more science is Saturn.  It's ""surface"" (1 bar) gravity is almost exactly 1g.  The temperature is -152C, which makes a hot (Saturnian) air baloon easier.  No acid to deal with there.  Solar radiation isn't an issue.  Way more science to do."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-12-25T08:28:00Z	UCqfFE01Mi022S0Npyk8BKuA	none		UgzRYcfKZfQW6fxXZMh4AaABAg

Sulfuric acid mixed with hydrogen creates a highly flammable compounds. That, and the fact that we are much closer to the sun with this planet using solar flares to maintain heat? I also would like to know more about how we would be able to manage the lava floods on the surface if we were to colonize on that surface. The only way I can see being closely realistic is through sky colonizing. And that itself will create quite a few problems still due to the fact that we are much closer to the sun, there’s a higher exposure to radiation.

"So if you're willing to go through all these resource intensive things to even build the simple floating cities let alone the full terraform, what's to stop you from digging down into the surface. As you naturally mine anyways, and then use those vast hollowed out areas to.. well build a lower colony. As has often been mentioned before, and is once more in the Titan video.. it could be a robot populated colony able to handle the heat but not as much the acid at this point as deep surface material is the shield. I can't help but wonder how much all the excess heat can be used in general at this point. We always talk solar, solar, solar, but if we're already building massive structures you could likely build a really massive geothermal rig here filled with the natural elements of Venus rather than lets say.. expensively imported.

Also, one other point I've always wondered in these videos... if you're willing to live in vastly self contained arcologies on earth, why not on Mars, Venus subteranean, or anywhere else like an asteroid. I mean, I don't really care how earth like a planet is if in my large dome if I have the luxuries I want. A large portion of the population is pretty home bound these days, and the illusion of sky that is well done can be just as good for a large portion living in a martian or any alien body. So for me, it really only matters if the place has the materials to build, and the ability to power my building that I live in a comfortable manner with the luxuries I wish. It's super cheap to build a massive pool for an entire arcology than import an ocean, and a high tech space pool is probably cleaner anyways!

Especially as corporations and governments are often going to be thinking on the short term. Need more space, energy, resources. Short term projects could possibly win out till the very day it's cost effective to dismantle Venus and you have people arguing over preserving it versus dismantling. Haha. So, I did like the mental floss of terraforming Venus, but all the middle ground potential of the colony before the massive super lengthy terraform process is decided on or gets anywhere near completion before hand. Even the idea of lowering the temperature could get people to the point. Okay, good enough here. Lets build a giant sealed city instead."

"Hi Arthur,
great Video as always.
I have a suggestion for a video topic. How about colonizing the oceans. I don't envision underwater Cities but more floating cities.

I think it will face similar challenges like colonizing Moons, Planets, Asteroids but can be done without getting off our planet.

What challenges will be faced by this Structures out on the Ocean? How can they be constructed tough enough to withstand salt water, Waves, Stormes not for decades but for centuries? How can they be made safe enough for families to live on?

Most importantly, why would they be built? (tax havens, sanctuaries, hideouts for super Villans) Why would someone create a city in the middle of the Pacific? What is a viable economic modell to sustain such an endeavour? 

keep up making great videos

"Just a thought, why couldn't we seed the clouds of Venus with Sulfuric acid resistance Blue-Green algae? The Algae would convert the CO2 into oxygen. There is sufficient water in the atmosphere of Venus to allow growth plus more than sufficient Sun light. As far as the rotational problem, If we are mining asteroids and using robots to collect material from deep space, why not re-direct comets into a glancing impact? They will deposit huge volumes of water, plus organics and if done several times, it could actual speed up rotation. An impact in the past is what causes Venus' slower rotation. A faster rotation could also kick start the magnetic field. We know Venus has a hot interior, more than likely a molten metal core, the active volcanoes all over tell us that.

"I thought it might be possible that Venus could be terraformed by humans from below. Robots could start the process by digging down into the soil and excavating tunnels. At the same time they could be processing any usable resources they come across. When a sufficient amount of tunnels are dug the tunnels opening could be capped off with an airlock and breathable air could be pumped into the tunnels. The lighter unusable materials excavated from the tunnels could be ejected high into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool the planet. This would be similar to the effect major volcanoes have on earth when they erupt and throw tons of ash into our atmosphere. This might cool the planet in a much shorter time. Tunnels would also solve the initial problem of solar radiation. 

I would appreciate a response from Isaac Arthur to know your thoughts on this proposal."	BI-old7YI4I	1	2017-10-01T17:06:17Z	UC53IL6IT7T8is7YGZB4NcAQ	none		Ugx4xpedK08Q4pY0QcJ4AaABAg

It's almost cruel that Venus is so similar to Earth and is in such a rubbish orbit. If I had colossal power at my fingertips, I'd move Venus out to 1.5 AUs from the sun an put Mars in orbit around it.

What about also genetically engineering algae to withstand the Venusian environment, and seed the planet. The algae uses it's natural ability of converting CO2 to oxygen, and also spreads/grows incredibly fast.

To simulate a 24 hour day/night cycle on Venus, could a floating colony be placed on the edge of the terminator at the equator, filling up charge from solar panels for 12 hours and thrusting to the dark side, drift for a few more hours during this night time, then coast back to the sunny side to represent morning and replenish solar charge? I imagine it might be like the summer sky at latitudes nearing the arctic circle on Earth, where the sun dips above and below the horizon each day. I'm curious what life would be like on that colony.

"Hi, Isaac Arthur. Another great video, BUT I think that your math doesn't check out when it comes to spinning Venus faster. You are talking about rotational energy, but you forgot about angular momentum, that must be conserved. In order to spin Venus to one rotation per day, you need to accelerate its surface to v=0.43km/s. The angular momentum of a solid sphere is 2/5MRv. so if we want to achieve it by hitting the surface horizontally with mass m, its velocity must be 2/5v*M/m. If we want to do this only by water, in quantities similar to Earth (mass of water is about 0.03% of Earth mass), we need velocity over 500km/s. This means about 3000 times more energy than the rotational energy itself, and we would have to do it over thousands of years to avoid heating surface to the point where all this water would just evaporate back into space.
In order to get such momentum with smaller energy budget, we need more mass. Much more, of an order of several percents of Venus mass. It would probably mean to move Mercury or Titan and collide it with Venus. It would probably be better to do the opposite: strip crust and upper mantle of Venus, like 5% of its mass, and shot it into space horizontally from equator with orbital velocity. This would require ""only"" about 100 years of Venus solar energy budget, and would give us enough material for decent planetary cloud."

It seems more feasible to colonize Venus, even with our limited 21st century technology. The largest problem with settlers on a terraformed planet is the difference in gravity from that of Earth.

So Isaac, is their any reason nobody talks about building rotating habitats of of nylon, or zylon, or dynemma? Sure, they're flexible, but steel reinforcement could solve that problem, and the organic elements are far more common in the universe than titanium or iron, and even though iron's quite common, chromium isn't so common that you could turn most iron into stainless steel.

Well it isn't really my price point Ghost, I'm just guessing as to why nobody's designed and named a specific Kevlar or Zylon habitat. I expect the first few to be built of titanium or aluminum honestly, and after that probably graphene, and carbon is plentiful. I wouldn't be surprised if none are ever built bigger than a few hundred kilometers wide without being built of graphene.

With a rotating habitat without a defined ceiling, like an O'neill Cylinder, would there be issues with the air near the center of spin interacting with itself? Turbulence? The station as a whole slowing down du to friction? Or would this system run smoother than I'm imagining it would?

What if they made hydrogen as a byproduct of creating antimatter from pure energy.   You get a lot of energy from the sun and even from the heat.  There's plenty of oxygen..  Sorry if you already mentioned this.    I listened all the way through and think you might have mentioned it.  Also the fact that venus doesn't have a magnetosphere suggests it doesn't have an iron core.  What's in the core?  What if the core has water?  Many moons have oceans under their surfaces.  There's a good chance it lost most of that water during volcanic activity but couldn't the heat actually have made the crust less brittle and less prone to volcanoes?   It turns so slowly and in the wrong direction which means it may have drifted toward the sun gradually.   I have a theory about how planets fall into orbit.   The closer they get the faster they orbit which makes it easier for planets to spiral into a stable orbit.  It's possible the core of Venus is actually cold and full of water or that hot ice stuff mentioned in some videos.

Venus should never be colonised in this way because of the hallucinary dangers. Venus is much brighter than Earth, so the effect of living upon Venus' atmosphere would be the equivalent of being completely surrounded by a bizarre shifting mirage and the constant play of light would drive the human mind to insanity. Space represents dangers so alien and threatening to a terran species, they we will never or seldom go there. Our planet has been made into a sort of playground for the wealthy, and the wealthy will never fund space exploration en masse, in the amounts required as discussed in this channel.  Seeing dismal, tiny expeditions to Mars and Venus ending in premature death and or mental illness will ram home this message to future generations.

"In case of space colonisation you are making one mistake. You assume that population will grow forever, but the reality is that in more developed countrys it's already not the truth. I.e.  I live in Poland, that is quite densly populated country. If the population double ... there will be still enaugh space and food for everyone, but the population slowly shrinks. I don't see any reason why I would abandon the luxury of Earth and live in a box floating in a venusian sulfuric accid clouds.

"I don't remember the source, but I remember reading something about Venus being a young (relatively speaking) world.
     Something about the surface temperature being far too high for greenhouse warming.  
     The problem with using hydrogen is it ""eats"" the material used to store it over a long term.  Hydrogen atoms are small enough to migrate its way through almost any material.  
     ""Closed"" type habitats have another use.  Really big, mobile research stations.  Build them, in the beginning, in Lunar orbit and send them where you want, and take your time.
     Take one of Jupiter's moons, move it to Venus.  Rotation changed to something close to Earth's, reawakened core provides EM field.  Problem solved!
     Jupiter's ""Big 4"" moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callista, if memory serves) all have the same problem.  They are within Jupiter's magnetic field.  Going there would kinda be like standing in a microwave.
     So...We move them.  Europa goes to Mars orbit, Ganymede to Venus.  Io we could put into one of Earth's Lagrange points (we really want that one where we can get to it.)  Maybe shift Callista to Mars, too.
     How do we move them?  That I leave as an exercise for the student.  Improve your Google-fu."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-09-10T16:54:46Z	UC2VH96yJdx-M5YNickg17mA	none		UgxmTL8aQDJcSK5nztZ4AaABAg

So what about engineering cyanobacteria to be bouyant and acid-resistant? They could inhabit a level of the venusian atmosphere where it's not too hot and process a hell of a lot of CO2. Maybe a mix of bacteria that cooperate to bind Nitrogen and Sulfur into aminoacids, too. With the increased solar radiation, mutation rates would be equally increased, which is generally beneficial to bacterial colonies.

"Thanks for doing this one.  I've always thought that Venus would be a better long-term prospect than Mars.  I'm all for bringing in a new moon for Venus.  I think that our moon's tidal forces on our core help both with keeping the interior of the planet molten and with generating the magnetic field.  I think a comparable moon for Venus would help in a similar way.  What I don't know if to combine a couple of Pluto-sized Kuiper belt objects to form a new moon, or whether a better solution would be to steal one from one of our gas giants (or perhaps wrangle Mercury into orbit).  If Venus had a moon similar to ours we could have five comfortably habitable worlds in the inner solar system: two earths (Terra & Venus) and three druidias (Mars, Luna & Cupid).  
Also, perhaps some future outposts should be named after Russian cosmonauts and Chinese taikonauts as well as American astronauts.  I'm sure that contributions from all three countries are going to prove necessary to make any of this happen."

"I don't think you could freeze out CO2.

The whole crust is a huge reservoir of heat, and cooling that down means cracks, pressure changes etc, which means vulkanism everywhere, for a very, very long time. And the heat flow through the crust would prevent any pockets of dry ice to be stable for a very long time too. And you dont want a huge resevoir of dry ice to bubble up uncontrolled.
But you don't have to freeze the CO2 out, much of it will react with the alcaline surface minerals to form carbonates. That happens as soon as you lower the temperature enough and introduce even a little bit of water. And you need another part of it later, as soon as you build a biosphere. Plants will use it up quite quickly and since venus has very little of it in its mantle - no plate tectonics means no carbonate cycle - you need to replenish it. So you have to find a way to store lots an lots of carbon - I guess as graphite or soot, etc. Graphite is much less chemically active than all those minerals in Venus' crust, so it should stay stable - at least until the oxygen level is high enough."

"I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking seriously about terraforming and colonizing Venus. In order to spin up the planet, my thought was to fly the planet with its own winds, using surface-tethered sails. I came up with the same rotational energy requirements, and spit-balled that you could accomplish the the rotation you needed with current wind speeds using about a quadrillion square meters of fully-engaged sail. But...maybe that's idiotic. It was still fun to break out the math ;)

You'll always end up with the heat/cool conflict, and I think orbital stations (at least initially) make more sense. If you can move a few large iron-rich objects into orbit around Venus, and slowly create orbital electromagnetic pills or capsules you could power with solar, then you can expand an artificial magnetosphere out from a single point into a loosely-tethered ring."

The main problem with planetary terraforming projects is generational, a 25th great-grandson typically doesn't even speak the same language as their far removed ancestor little more follow that person's instructions to complete a task. More often than not, that far back, someone is just genetic background noise completely forgotten. Even nations, corporations, religious organizations, and empires struggle to persist over such vast timeframes. Cathedrals, Vast Canals, the Great Wall, Pyramids, highway & interstate systems and every other megastructures or other projects like interplanetary exploration till now is accomplished within 20 to 50 years, from breaking ground. The span of a master-patron or designers' lifespan. One or two, at the most three career successions between the project start and finish. Beyond that, and the entire project's plan starts to have fragmentary holes in it, and disagreeing academics competing textual criticisms!

"Regarding long term terraforming:
I don't think shading Venus is a too bright idea.

Calculation exercise #1:
If all the sunlight that hits Venus where turned of instantly and permanently how long would it take approximately such that venus ""ground"" temperature would cool down to nice seeming 300K? 
Note that reaching 300K at the liquid CO2 ocean ""ground"" would make the zone with human friendly 1atm pressure (high above this ""ocean"") uncomfortably cold. Cooling down even further such that one reaches one 1atm on a dry ice glacier surface leads obviously to a surface temperature of about earths dry ice temperature. Not too inviting.

Calculation exercise #2: If instead the whole solar power that hits the planet is used to sequester away the atmosphere how long would that take?

Side-note: CO2 and SO3 should prefferably be sequestered to moissanite SiC, pyrite FeS, hematite Fe2O3 and some remnant oxygen O2. In case one would sequester the atmosphere to free oxygen and  various forms of pure carbon (graphitic, diamondoid) then one may risk a ""brief"" but hyper-epic global firestorm destroying all the work done.

To speed up a sequestering type terraforming prozess (going totally carzy here now) one would need to even focus light onto Venus. To prevent planetary overheating one could (I think) use heat pumps that go with their hot side into  space radiators on the planets night side. These radiators would need to be kept at a temperature as high as possible >3000K.
Thermal radiation power (here cooling power) goes with the fourth power of temperature. That helps a lot.
Efficiency of course needs to drop if one comes near the temperature of the sun (its a thermodynamic engine after all). But there aren't any materials capable of handling temperatures much above 3000K anyway."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-09-08T13:15:31Z	UCPQGm36Vn-fAooc0jRLqyAw	none		Ugz_jS5a9Gp2q6jBCD14AaABAg

"The sad thing is though, with how we are treating Earth there is a very good chance it will become a second Venus before we even have a chance to colonize other planets in our solar system, many scientists  believe we have already reached the tipping point for a runaway green house effect, as Global temperatures rise and more CO2 is released into the atmosphere its creating a feedback loop that bakes sublimated CO2 out of the Earths bones and increases evaporation from the oceans allowing more and more thermal energy to be trapped in our atmosphere.

And the biggest joke of all, if the conspiracy theorists are right about hidden bunkers being built to protect the rich/chosen few from global disaster it wont help, as more CO2 and other gases are released into the atmosphere eventually the pressure will get so high that any bunkers will implode.

But I do have hope that we can change before our politicians and corporations destroy our Biosphere its a small hope but it keeps me breathing."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-09-09T02:47:35Z	UC15cheoIIYNFOCQS8eUaGtg	none	Ugyz9wLe8iZ3Tn2lSgx4AaABAg	Ugyz9wLe8iZ3Tn2lSgx4AaABAg.8XFReQ2Ls5V8XGyETFfhOI

"I hear it again and again but is Venus' lack of a ""proper"" magnetic field (""proper"" meaning: created by a geodynamo) really that bad? At the one atm / one bar level the atmosphere alone corresponds to about 10m of water-depth by mass. Wile carbon dioxide may be not as good in shielding as water this shielding mass should still be pretty good. Or am I wrong? Also on earth there where a lot of pole-flips and none of them wiped out all higher land life. On Earth without technology the destruction of the ozone layer by unblocked solar wind (inhowfar does/did this happen during pole-flips?) would be bad but with technology the solution to a missing ozone layer like on Venus is called ""windows""."

Not mentioned: While even hydrogen filled balloons can't carry too thick layers of soil (about 1m of soild with water like density per 500m ballon-height) they could float at dozens of non-intersecting layer hights. That could on the long run (after continuous small on demand expansion) provide more surface area than earth has to offer today.

You didn't mention how ridiculously long it would take for Venus to cool using a shade. That's the primary reason why terraforming Mars is much more practical than terraforming Venus. You can walk between your home and a mine on the surface in little more than a jacket and a mask much sooner on Mars than you could Venus, hundreds or thousands of years of terraformation versus millions of years respectively.

They never stopped the program. They use high altitude platforms that float at around 50,000ft to act as docking stations for giant inflatable exchange points, and semi orbit down southern hemisphere. The stations are comprised of up to 11 massive triangular TR3Bs. These use magnus effect generators and solar panels these days to permanently stay up, except for maintenance schedule drops. They electrolyse the thin atmospheric water , and harvest nitrogen to make rocket fuels. Giant space tugs inflate massive breaking balloons that allow them with skipping to reenter earth orbit over a period of days, without much drama. They float to the docking stations for payload transfer. The tr3bs in orbit join together to form rings of 9-11 ships ,rotate at about 0.7G. Radiation is managed by huge tanks of frozen water that over time have been shuttled into orbit by these remote control orbital transit vehicles. The discardable 1 megawatt reactor based extremely loosely on nucleat sub designs is suspended by high tension guy wires in the centre of the structure. Water is pumped to and from the reactors by cooling tubes from the spinning structure. The spinning orbital is sent via ionised water ion engines out of earths orbit and to anywhere you want. The main destination is has and will be for a long time to come to venus, because the administration learnt a lon time ago that closer to to sun is better than further away. We only use venus because it is excellent for fuel, for protection from solar and cosmic rays, and whatbhas been hidden from earths population, has so much heavy metals in orbit and other pullutants that we literally harvest resources by filtering the atmosphere. This enabled the original colony (with some help) to continue building. Thats good because even though not intended, the science community that volunteered for this lifetime job have had children and a colony is actually growing, currently at several thousand.

I don't think there's much difference between living on a cloud platform and living on an oil platform or an aircraft carrier. If it was raining or foggy you would stay inside, but most of the time you could go out with minimal protection. The acid clouds are vapor and a suit could protect you in most cases. If something happened and you fell off there are nets and inflatable backpacks that can save you. I would be more concerned with how much bobbing and weaving would happen day to day and during storms.	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-09-08T10:35:31Z	UCvNfJphCIP1aviv7smVxKwQ	none		UgwDJehT_J3c7s9GIkN4AaABAg

The blackbody temperature of Venus is actually NOT hot. Something like -90 Celsius. Overall, about the same amount of blackbody radiation escapes as on Mars, even though it is more than triple the area. About 90% of the incoming light is immediately reflected away.

You've given me hope for humanities future Issac but I'd like to address some of the idealism you seem to have regarding prospects for our future. Do you believe that simply having the ability to do so is valid justification for massive projects that lack monetary value? What if we reach a point where our population stabilizes and we exist in a utopic bliss here on Earth? Can this be the eventual fate of all Intelligent sentient life? I've enjoyed many of your videos but sometimes I find myself questioning the feasibility of some of the more complex projects you present and then I consider contemporary society. How can any government justify such expenditure while they're held accountable by their constituents. How can a private company procure the funds for such a civil undertaking? This just doesn't seem like the path we're going to go down right now. But that's only right now.. If we exist 10,000 years from now I'm sure it will all be quite different.

So far the reason to colonize any planet beyond our own is, at least for now, about mining the elements that are needed to further exploration and industrialization. It seems the best way to create 'new worlds' is orbital settlements that use the martian or venutian settlements as nothing more than a place to land, accumulate and process materials, and then send them back up to space for commerce and/or construction of whatever the human race is currently working on. .

One of the interesting things about biology is the use of chemical energy storage(in the citric acid cycle for ex)  Considering that sulfuric acid stores a tremendous amount of chemical energy, and we have plenty of extremophiles on earth that use it, we could find a way to use that too. disassociate with one molecule to get 3 we want.  also, the charge in the atmosphere from the acid could make ion drives even more efficient.

"Isaac, great video as always, but you should properly give credit to the sources of some of these ideas - a couple were right out of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars Trilogy"" (there was quite a lot about Venus in the books too) - what you said here was identical to what Robinson wrote. Ringworld is no doubt an influential book, but it stuck me as strange that you would promote Ringworld and all it's remarkable unscientificness and not the book where these ideas actually come from."

Issac, so do you believe that the most efficient way of creating new human habitats in space is still the O'Neill Cylinder concept from a materials and energy perspective?  It seems like the Moon, Mars, and Venus are all great places to get materials for building O'Neill Cylinders, but they don't seem very practical for large human habitats from a pure cost perspective, plus it just seems like we can control all the environmental conditions (temperature, gravity, etc) easier in a cylinder vs. on a planet or the moon.  It reminds of the Bobiverse book series where the humans found living in enclosed floating cities to be the most idyllic of conditions even though they had planets that were marginally Earth-like.  Thoughts?	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-09-08T02:57:11Z	UCqu-c1pJQg0dXfupUpjawAQ	none		UgxJLG_mB_vyPVjio5x4AaABAg
With uplifting one of the things that should be considered is the tactical implications. I mean even as humans with a common heritage we would slowly diverge which would undoubtedly cause wars and conflicts. So why would we want to uplift a xenos to compete or rival the expanse of humanity. There are some good reasons not to uplift, rather instead use them for experimentation, extermination or exterminatus. Subjugation maybe an option but as shown throughout human history right up until the english abolitionist movement, this is subject to uprisings, cultural mixing or abolition/integration. Subjugation would also assume that human morality would regress enough to permit this. There are so many ways you can take this conversation I am looking forward to it, I hope you also find some time to talk about the malevolent arguments also.

You keep mentioning that we could liquefy and even freeze the atmosphere of Venus, but you never mention the timescale. How long to lquify? How long to freeze? How long to for Venus's temperature without an atmosphere? And what is Venus's natural temperature?

Might be abit of a silly question, but if we made a huge straw, and placed it in space and the atmosphere and placed it far enough away from Venus, couldn't you just suck away the atmosphere, using the massive pressure difference, You could then gather all your sucked out atmosphere and transport it to somewhere like Mars to increase its atmosphere?

"Problem(s) with Venus above Mars are too numerous. For one, it's in an orbital correction phase. It'll be many years before it gets set back into its proper orbit, which makes surface settlements highly improbable for a very long time.

Secondly, there's too much that would need to be taken from and moved away. All that methane is a problem that terraforming Mars wouldn't have to worry about. 

Third, it's too close to the sun. So eventually it's only going to get hotter and hotter. Best to work in the other direction, as it's much easier to heat a thing up than to cool it down. Move in the direction the star is expanding to, not the other way."	BI-old7YI4I	0	2017-09-08T00:23:04Z	UCRqBygqFoeG7DTY8N1oSKQg	none		UgwlZE4UhlbfRwIpQQR4AaABAg

The problem with considering projects like terraforming a planet that takes many hundreds of years, or even 1000+ years, is that there's really no point in doing it now.   If you wait just a hundred years, your tech will likely be able to do it in a much shorter amount of time, or you might get to a point where you just dont want to or need to do it.   You really need to weigh the time needed versus the possible improvements in tech over time.  Bellow a certain timeframe, it makes sense.  Above a certain timeframe, it's better to just wait.

This might be a good idea for a future video, but you talk so much about HOW we can terraform different planets, but we never go into WHY (other than to live there). there is no real economic reason to terraform a planet, which is what businesses are looking for. there is no profit to be made, unless earth became so crowded that people will pay to move elsewhere. there isn't really any reason to terraform a planet because there is no profit to be made. sure, its convenient to not have to wear a suit when you go outside, or to not have to take special measures to insulate a building, but again, I don't think that would be such a large issue to warrant a full scale terraform.

"I hate to say it, but you missed some key points which could have connected to your colonizing the solar system videos. For one, it's important to note that colonizing Venus is on the order of a couple hundred years, if not less using multiple stages and approaches. That's a really significant point in its favor.

Two, Hydrogen bombardment isn't the only game in town for carbon sequestration. Mining Magnesium and Carbon from Mercury, which you mentioned in your other videos, allows you to sequester carbon into minerals, a la Mark Bullock and David H. Grinspoon. It's estimated you could also find a significant portion of calcium in Venus's crust as well, which could be exposed using the orbital bombardment you'd probably employ to stir up the surface anyway.

You also didn't mention the possibility of using GMO's to help modify the atmosphere, which is a real shame, seeing how it's one of the oldest proposals and would greatly accelerate the deposit of bio-materials on the surface from die-off and reproduction. This is completely possible if you cool the atmosphere using solar shades.

You're doing a false dichotomy, there's no science vs fiction here except when I explicitly say something is scientifically iffy, we only do hard science, the engineering or practicality is another story.

Seems to me like the Hydrogen supply might be one potentially useful business for the Titan colony, it would potentially make for a good refuelling point for ships going to Saturn to collect Hydrogen or heading out towards Venus given it's ample supply of Hydrocarbons. Along with the Oxygen that Enceladus keeps blasting in Titan's direction though if they need more guess they could always send ships into the plumes of Enceladus directly or into Saturn's rings and gather it to fuel up ships with.

It is not 110000 miles a second to get out of earths orbit 
If it moved 11000 miles a second it wouldn't take 8 1/2 minutes

Why would you push the comet in? I think the first thing would be to decelerate it, so it is no longer in orbit, then perhaps push it slightly sunward so it does not take forever to fall into the inner system. But then, when it arrives in the vicinity of the orbit of Jupiter or the asteroid belt (You orbital mechanics folks determine exactly where.) you would need to decelerate it so it would not just blast past the destination and fall into the sun.

"Very nice to see Elmer Fudd got work narrating youtube vids.
Design elements that are realistic (and should therefore exist in serious sci-fi) are but not limited to: modular design in general, allowing easy expansion of additional living quarters, additional engines, additional fuel reserves, cargo holds, etc. sensible engine configuration. Attainting speed is half of the coin. Let’s say you could reach 20 million miles per hour. You need to slow down before reaching your destination. Therefore, engines need to be either, rotatable, or a double ended design, both forward and aft, from a centralized power source. On the subject of centralization, the command decks (two) should be atop and below the main body of the ship, akin to a tank turret or zeppelin gondola allowing for maximum view in any direction. The best design would be a central power structure with engines pointing in both directions, command “whiskers” centrally located down the long axis, above & below. Overall surrounded by two modular/expandable “cylinders” comprised of various modules (science, storage, living quarters)... gapped centrally to avoid the command “whiskers” and set to rotate. This would provide a number of solutions, artificial gravity, the ability to drop shipments from orbit, and entire modules serve as life boats which can be jettisoned in a cam type manner, putting them all string-like arc, simplifying rescue. Each module would have it’s own dedicated (and shareable via modular design) water storage on the “bottom” outside area, both providing potable water and radiation shielding from any outside sources. The command crew work shifts would be dictated by the rotation of the cylinder shells, because the doors from whiskers to modules would align only every so often, but work shifts are not a new concept for people. Lastly, maneuvering thrusters. Lots of them. Guesstimate how many is “more than you will ever need,” and then double that amount. No matter how state of the art your engines might be, if you cannot point yourself toward home, you’re not going to get there. There’s lots of stuff out there, asteroids, etc, that may be in your path. Don’t assume docking collars will be aligned for you by god. Don’t assume gravitational pulls on a ship will be constant, moons on the far side of a planet for example will increase the combined gravitational pull (tidal effect) on a ship, and you’ll need those thrusters."

Spherical shape should fit best. It have smallest surface area and smallest volume(weight) possible, its symmetric, it is easy to create gravity by rotation, and most important it is possible to cover craft with A LOT of armor in layers. As armor I understand any layers of something - solar panels, antennas, water, soil, furniture, hydroponic bays, electronics, food, fuel,  resource storages etc. Ship will need to be made like a onion in a lot of layers and all this layers will have different density and works as composite armor shielding, defending from collisions and radiation. All layers easy to divide by hexagon, square or triangle sectors, and make them like independent and hermetic containers, so if few layers will be damaged by collision - astronauts can close them and fix in full pressure suits or just recycle or throw out if they are too damaged to repair.

We live in a world where we listen to a narrator with a heavy speech impediment and are supposed to act like it makes no difference. As the American comedian Steve Martin use to say...”Well EXCUSE me!” I’m not going to waste 32 minutes trying to figure out what the narrator said because I won’t learn anything if I’m spending the entire 32 minutes trying to determine what his last word was over and over again. I understand that this must be good therapy but why on earth would a person with a severe speech impediment think he could be a good video narrator?

To create a space ship to take to Mars, we would need materials that don’t exist yet. Metal alloys super strong and able to have a strong tensile strength and a high pipe scheduling. Artificial gravity is needed by centrifuged spin. Water jacked around the habitable and computer areas. A dynamo is required of large enough size to create a shield around the structure along with generating electrical current for the ship. A new shuttle craft (capsule or slowing balloon) would be needed. In low atmosphere pressures you would need airships to fly inside the planets atmosphere.

"No No No. Interstellar ships require a minimum of 200-metres radius, so you can spin the ship to create 0.9G on the inner surface. The long, pencil shaped craft needs a parabolic shaped forward shield which is 980-metres across at the leading edge. This size shield ensures that when the ship is going slower than its maximum speed (around 0.2C - is maximum according to my  calculations for ramscoop efficiency) that dust particles will not strike the ship.
At 0.2C a single interstellar dust grain carries the impact energy of a 50-caliber sniper rifle bullet. And a single grain of sand hits with the force of over 50-tons of TNT.
There are no rotating rings possible on a starship, because you'd have to shield the entire ring - which would be utterly impossible - because you need a shield 1,000-metres thick.
Most people are ignorant fools who know nothing, and the only viable starship design I have ever seen is sitting on my wall right now. I designed it.
""Graphic Designers"" are the most stupid and ignorant people on the planet, and that is why we see Masturbation Fantasies from them, instead of possibly viable spaceship designs."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-08-23T23:13:52Z	UCs6hNriROONs8sB_78qS8Gg	none		UgxmmY2d1jPt6TFR88V4AaABAg
"Nuclear option could be also a nuclear reactor delivering energy for el. mg. accelerator like a Li-7 Th HTR or cold fusion shooting Hg out of ring tube accelerators into tubes with water causing acceleration of ship in that direction from linear slow down then back with Hg in ring tube accelerator that wax not loosing mass additional Hg H->H punsh fusion and Hg neutron spallation to Hg-197 with epsilon decay to Au-197.
Added CO2 turbines with cf compressor backflow cioling of all thermal isolated, generator ..

It wouldn't make a lick of sense to produce components in situ as that is mass and weight inefficient. You'd need to bring extra energy, materials, components and possibly crew to produce the components in situ and then what happens when the component you made has a defect which requires scrapping the material and starting over again?

Then there is no mass to have to deal with and own gravity field so one is fixed to ships gravity field and take turns at 1000.000 km/h without harm.

Yet the TR3B's drive system, being partly anti-grav allows 3 thrusters for stability on a triangular craft.  Assuming that the primitive drives that the public knows about (rocket thrust) is an antique, this entire discussion changes.  As for faster than light drive, the craft needs to be symmetrical around the toroidal field, so the saucer/triangle shape makes the most sense.

"For a ships nose cone. To minimize magnetic metal ore meteoroids striking it why don't you have a magnetizing field projected from it and a high intensity field closer to the hull? If they a both positively charged they repel right?
.
 This can also be used if you are slowly coasting into a meteoroid field to attract them to your nose cone and grab it up (I'm talking inch wide pieces in an intra solar path a kind of street sweeper). These should be 100% automated or training/penal ships (go practice for helm training and an intra solar version of community service for minor infractions of law.)"

Energy-centers from lowest to highest, above, for Ones well being in the FORM of Physical and Spiritual.


Each
 energy-sphere has a certain sound (Frequency = Hz) of music that they 
vibrate on and when you MAKE THE SAME SOUND IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU ARE 
HEARING while listening to the sound while meditating or just listening 
with headphones to get the maximum effect and tuning the sound into your
 MIND. You can also listen all of the frequencies at the same time, but 
first listen to them one at the time.
WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT 
RESPONSIBILITY. As SPIRIT in a PHYSICAL FORM, is a BEING of FREQUENCY of
 HARMONIOUS SOUND can make items vibrate with their MIND, by learning 
the SOUND for their MIND, for benefit of OTHERS and your-SELF by 
creating the frequency of the Hz above with your MIND and then directing
 it to an ITEM or another BEING.

The latest lot of patents the navy has made public just makes most of this stuff obsolete straight off the bat. The flying triangle patent they made public has gravity wave emitters as part of the propulsion so I wouldn't be at all surprised if they have figured out some way of maintaining a 1G environment on their vessels' already.

you would want a perfect sphere. stuff around can move in any direction at any speed in space, so if you do not have shielding from behind, you may get hit from behind. the best surface area to volume is achieved with a sphere. allso, if that sphere accelerates at 1g , then you will have gravity on that ship as long as you accelerate. when you want to stop, you gona have to make a 180 degree turn, and then brake at 1g, to have the same 1g gravity. turning around , or changing direction even in space involves inertia, and a sphere for that reason is a perfect shape to have.

Wouldn't consistent acceleration be better for an inter system ship, being that you could use that acceleration as artificial gravity. That might not be plausible for large ships moving over interstellar distances, but just going from one heavenly body to another would be much more conducive to using acceleration as a faux gravitational force	V4ddnrBT6hE	1	2020-07-16T18:04:27Z	UCzH1CuQRqAX7fWx-NATobVA	none		Ugxi_PJaHYvM4EP89ix4AaABAg

"Interesting topic and  concept  space and space travel. while I do agree with some of what you've said in this video. I also disagree with a lot more of it. In my opinion I honestly think that the author of Star Trek Gene Roddenberry had the right idea with the first launch of a new spacecraft in the  next generation episode that took the Enterprise back in time to effrum cockren's first flight. two very important things we need to develop for space travel first an engine design that will get us their and back in seconds rather than years. Second a deflector that will project a shield around the out side of the craft to deflect all forms of space debris.Then we can start discussing where we want to go in space and how long its going to take to get there and back.
I also think we would be better off building a shipyard in orbit of the planet and discontinue heavy rocket launches in to space."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-07-09T00:29:53Z	UCBEDfq5cH1wZNa_MsVCIVcA	none		UgzFb4-hJtdHJTBnUmZ4AaABAg

Humans always thought they were in the center of the universe and were always proven wrong. How others may have contact us, when this violent, vicious, selfish, stubborn race doesn't want to admit the existance of other more civilised entities, who cherish others around in the void of space, instead of barbarian shootings, killings, experiments just to grasp foolish way of understanding the technology that has been hidden before our eyes by the 'elite' groups of enterprises like Skunkworks, who's their only goal is to enslave ppl, more and more under the hood of false security, aka cia and nsa (read facebook). Those flying ships, like TR3-B (Astra), Project Aurora (7xMach), came after 2nd war, when agents of now existant cia, under oath of Project Paperclip, took best scientists from nazi's to continue to develop so called 'Die Glocke' engine originally made under Hitler's supervision. Almost all those lights is just side-effect of being electrostatically charged, which ignites atmosphere around. How convenient to hide some dark secrets - why they fly all the time and never land? - under the ufo agenda. That way no question will be asked anymore, right, and even when some MHD-mercury-spinning ship will fall, toxic or not, ppl will be afraid. Dont be afraid, their time came to an end, they are afraid of us and of loosing control over us. Good luck reasonable ppl of this beautiful planet.

It seems like normal-velocity ships would prefer more spherical shapes(to reduce surface area), especially if cancer was still a problem or if moving in high radiation zones like the Jupiter system, though not so much near the sun, since that would demand the ability to radiate heat, and you might also want to collect solar power.

"A hospital I worked in threw away lots of books and there was one I must have read over and over. I can't recall the title or author & being sci-fi not even close to the genres I liked. However it was design of the ships that was amazing. They were huge, God tier intelligent & hyper technologically advanced. Each ship was a huge mind & specializing in a field, for example holding humans in suspension or animated until a viable planet was found. 
Due to distances travelled there was soars time, one used the suspended humans to recreate ancient battles in a virtual world. It would spend years getting all the details to create a snapshot, then start again. So 
A ship like that would be amazing, able to hold millions of people either active or suspended. So far advanced they're able to contain various environment and be fully self sufficient."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-06-17T00:59:07Z	UC5KptlFdBHcWx_592KQZuOg	none		UgzgPxFb_zoLNF-eC2d4AaABAg

"I salute you sir. It is very rare to find an analysis that negates all the holes one tries to poke into it before the end. A few remarks still though.
Overall the whole conundrum is one of energy against mass. In short. Thin shielded fusion or something very close ( I tend to call it the Mr Fusion concept) will be required. Such an ultracompact energy technology might even bring the old mistake of spaceships being seemingly empty shells which are almost devoid of underpining technology somewhat closer to reality. 
Beside industrial comet tugging ships which you cover very eloqeuntly I do not share your vision on the rotating parts of large ships being minimal. Since only starting the initial rotation and regulating it would cost energy it would be much more logical to build a ship that is almost fully rotational with only the parts that specifcally need to be non-rotational being keept in equilibrium against the surrounding space. So things like off bore communication and sensor arrays, orientational /correctional thrusters and spaces you intentionally want to keep zero gravity. This would solve the whole conondrum of humans not being built for non-gravity surroundings in one go.
A sense of threedemonional awereness of the occupants could simply be obtained by using video screens. Looking through portholes in the floor would after all tend to make you dizzy.
So alas: The spaceship of the future will probably be a rather plain looking (semi-)streamlined torpedo with a few rotating sections and some foldable protusions for low speed / static purposes. One rotating section woudl be near the nose or on it, others midship and near aft.
As far as ratios are concerned: One would then indeed expect a minimum diameter to accomodate a reasonable rotational speed while almost all the rest of the mass might be distributed over length. Within certain limitations of course. Sooner or later shearing forces induced by thrusters on ultra long moment arms will put a stop to ever increasing lengths.
Only warshps might clearly deviate from that norm, assuming the drive will not be the main weapon anyway. 
Everyhting else, from beautifully shaped, non-rotating ships (type Swan Of space) with or without planetary landing capabilities through truly practical interstellar ships all SF Mc Guffins (like artifical gravity and FTL) would first have to become real science."

Another thing that could be important: in case we ever develop FTL technology, having the entire fleet of spacecraft physically lock together for warp might have to be necessary in order for time dilation to affect all of a fleet uniformly. That way if a small fighter slowed down suddenly due to an impact it would not suddenly change time flow and experience a different reality than the one the other spacecraft would.

"About your statement that to send a better and a hundred times more expensive hammer up than one that’s heavier and cheaper: why? Making a hammer inherently more expensive means people will believe that the money involved has less and less functional effect and value on the whole of developing a space program that gets things into space, in the first place! 

In other words, why send a 15 ton spacecraft for a hundred times more when you can launch a 75 ton spacecraft for 20 times cheaper with technology that is at least proven? Even if you could make the lighter spacecraft more fuel efficient what’s the point of making a problem more difficult than it needs to be?

Speaking of making a problem more difficult than it needs to be, has nobody figured out that the problem of greenhouse gases is a solution to fueling and getting heavier things into orbit, like parts for a large Starcraft? Considering the billions of tons of CO2 and other gases, there likely is a way to shorten the carbon cycle that is far more feasible than launching rocket upon rocket into space without turning the world into a inhospitable place."

Algae lives in water so algae in bioreactors should be able to withstand the high g forces associated with dramatic maneuvers so biologic processing of CO2 back into oxygen is still possible with military craft though I suspect mechanical chemical backups would also exist as they can be adjusted as needed.  Algae also produced all the amino acids we need and though NASA determined we can not consume more than 50 grams of algae per day, it may be possible to process it into a feedstock to use in a synthetic food printer, if you only consider our current technology, fish easily converts algae into a higher value food product.

So my question is this, why would we waste resources towing things around in space.  Since atmosphere isn't an issue, it's trajectory can only be manipulated by gravity wells and debris, wouldnt it make more sense to simply fire it from Point A through some type of tube launching system, and then just have something on the receiving end plot an intercept course to pick it up on arrival?  For example, if you are in the belts on the far side of mars.  You could launch an ice block from a tube towards mars, just close enough that passes low orbit.  Then another ship already at mars flies out to intercept, and bring its speed down until it is in stable orbit.  After that you just plot a maneuver that takes it to its final destination.  This saves time, crew, shipping costs, fuel, frees up a space craft, and most importantly itkeeps people at the belt, allowing for more things to be sent over the same period of time, not only building a better logistics chain, but also putting in a fail safe that allows new items to be sent faster if any errors occur in route.

Lol, people think we're going somewhere. Humans aren't going anywhere unless we get our act together and unless shit hits the fan real quick (at which point it is likely too late), that isn't happening. Think of how far we could've been if space exploration was given the attention and financing it was  a couple decades ago. it would bankrupt the world and for that not to happen, we'd have to abandon money as a system of value, but humans like to feel superior to each other so that won't happen. Merrily till extinction we shall march hand in hand from birth to oblivion, in the same place we started, believing we accomplished something because we made money.

I mean, the closest things we have to spaceships here on the ground (aside from spaceships funny people) are boats, spaceships are literally that, space SHIPS, ships here on earth have a ton of different uses, there are military ships, small boats and canoes for holding 1-4 people, yachts for driving around at hogh speeds, holding more people and other recreational purposes, police ships with huge floodlights for seeing into the water in the dark, cruises and so much more, spaceships should totally have like; some standard designs that are very good on the basic spaceship stuff and then have a bunch of specialized models	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-05-12T07:50:01Z	UCcmycdRjuvKLe9hMtMzZpyw	none		Ugw84haL9qNBTvsOaN14AaABAg

"Thanks!  I think the main idea here could be summed up by the statement: ""In space, *_everything is a trade-off._*""  I think that, ultimately, several of the ideas you mentioned - modular design, retracting parts (such as antennae, cameras, telescopes, probes, guns?!?, etc.), & even overall designs that can expand (or inflate) - will become fairly standard (though not necessarily standardized!).  As to aesthetics, I recall the (otherwise terrible) movie ""The Black Hole"", by Disney (through their then-new Touchstone Pictures brand).  The design of the main spaceship actually won an award.  It was a scaffold-like super-structure, long & narrow, & did in no way resemble what most of us think of as a 'rocket ship'.  I must add here that I believe we will not really see any of the things discussed in this video start to come true until we have a space-based industry.  That is, until there are people working (& living out their lives) in space - in the asteroid belt, for instance.  At that point, most space ships will be built far from Earth, & will have little to do with Earth industries, or even with the concerns of Earth-bound humans (saving, of course, economic concerns!)  Only the idea that some big company will (for the foreseeable future) want to have its financial base physically on Earth - or, at the very least, have a physical presence there - will hold any tenuous connection between Earth & the rest of the Solar System.   Speaking of moving cargo (such as water ice with volatiles), I can well imagine that it would be desirable to know not only how much stuff there is in a particular comet (for instance), but also to know how much of which materials it contains.  I can see a technology wherein a manned or unmanned ship could approach a comet, & shoot it with a spear-like device, which would simply impale the comet.  This spear would be a kind of probe, which could then tell something about the contents of the comet, by virtue of its being deeply buried straight into it (sort of like a core sample, but with the spear having the ability to tell what materials are around it, along its length).  Also, a large net of some kind might then be deployed around a suitable comet, which could then be attached to an engine of some sort, for towing.  I suppose much of this process could be automated.  If something is found that's wanted, one could simply hit a button called, ""acquire & return"", whereupon the only thing left to do would be to wait.  Communications would be vital out there.  They (not 'us' - but 'they'!) would want to have a network deployed, which could handle large bandwidth, as well as a kind of GPS.  Things like laptops & tablets would have to be built to operate & survive in vacuum, and take a lot of abuse.  I love reading hard sci-fi about people living & working in space, creating cities inside asteroids, etc.  I know I've gone off topic here, but I'll still take the opportunity to add one thing.  If we (either on Earth, and/or in space) have something like Star Trek replicators, I think it'll be a long, long time into the future.  On a generation ship, it'll be key to have many industries (though highly modified from what would exist on Earth, of course!), & to train new generations to build, use, & maintain things.  I speculate that it might be useful to have guilds, as well as formal apprenticeship, in such cases.  But from now going forward, I think we'll develop a combination of 3D printing, & nanotechnology.  I wonder if the two could ever be combined on some way.  As to rotating drums, that's fine, of course, as long as the ship is not pulling Gs.  If it's rotating *_while the ship is under perpendicular acceleration_*, that could make for a rather confusing time!  At any rate, for a ship that might need to accelerate in any given direction (to avoid large debris, for instance), it's going to mean sudden jerks (as you pointed out).  I would imagine that any ship under more than 1/10th G would have to have everything - including people - 'battened down', as they say.  I recall reading, ""The Mote in God's Eye.""  They had 2 different possible orientations for the ship: one while it was stationary, in orbit, or coasting - and another, perpendicular direction for acceleration.  Of course, they also had much specialized equipment, like waterbeds & even mobile chairs, for when they were pulling more than about 1 1/2 Gs.  They made ship-wide announcements, warning people to get ready for a certain amount of acceleration, for a set period of time.  It was space navy, of course, so military efficiency was expected.  That might be necessary on some level.  At any rate, I don't think much - if any - of this technical, practical stuff is going to be worked out by us while we're sitting around here on Earth!  It's going to have to be decided on the basis of, ""Well, here we are out in space: now what do we need to solve these problems?""  That's one of the main reasons I'm convinced that the people who do venture out there will not only work, but live there, too.  And they'll have to solve their own problems.  One final point: wouldn't traveling at a highly relativistic velocity cause Cherenkov radiation (or some such)?  I can't recall the details, but I'm sure I've seen or heard somewhere that, when traveling that fast, you actually get some kind of extra radiation coming at you (not just dust, gas, or the CMB).  Anyway, thanks again for another great video.       tavi."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-05-11T17:20:34Z	UCyH5dtaM-OPXcWVZSzW0yNg	none		Ugw-qVpgW3YRhoQ_lOl4AaABAg

"What we need is to say f the cost and start building infrastructure in space. Automated mining, refining, construction, and transportation. Yes it's going to bankrupt nation's who put up one or two facilities with few human resources onsite. Yet if you put up a single or human pair and hundreds of robots controlled from the ground until the infrastructure is safe, reliable, and cheaper you save much more in the long run.
 (a belief of mine is less than 5% of humans can think past a ten to twenty year span of time and less than .2% can think of a century ahead. Basically humans don't think long game but short and not even that well.)

 Cost in this endeavor are moot. If a planet busting asteroid hits us now we don't even have but two pieces of interstellar junk that said we were HERE. When all I hear news wise is cost (money resource or human) I get mad as hell because cost is a human genital measuring sdick. If we want our decendants ten or twenty generations down the line to be here we need to get off our butts and get back into space. Yet I see the people around interested in power, sports, sex, and controlling a slice of nothing with an iron fist until a bigger fist breaks them. So I'm guessing with the next 150 years we destroy OURSELVES over ""costs"" of everything."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-05-10T08:42:47Z	UCIyxUmDtvjGTkIcBv421ZCg	none		UgxKMf0a4EG7KOO0r2p4AaABAg

"I love astronomy but I lost interest in spaceflight and colonization initiatives years ago -- especially when the shuttle was retired without a replacement.  Fact is -- no matter how its presented or how cheap it may be, we'll never do any of this stuff.  Even the private spaceflight initiatives are more about space tourism and making a buck than in actual exploration, discovery, and pushing for FTL technology.  In fact, the idea of ""making a buck"" is what has stagnated our technology.  Almost all of the tech invented in the last half century involves merely adding more bells and whistles to existing technology, whether it be smart phones, 3D televisions, or cars that can drive themselves.  Yeah, the car can drive itself but under the hood is the same 120 year-old inefficient and hopelessly obsolete internal combustion engine that might get 35 mpg under optimum conditions.  Naturally, the ""powers that be"" who make excessive amounts of money on fossil fuels will resist any new tech that might put them out of business.  As Nikolai Tesla's financial benefactor said:  ""If I can't put a meter on it and charge money for it, I'm not going to support it.""  Thus Tesla's ""tower of power"" was abandoned and the hope of global free energy was doomed, never to resurface in over a century.  


Today's tech might seem amazing -- but only when compared to the past.  In terms of where humanity **should** be, our technology is abyssmally slow-evolving and lacks true innovation.  These days, technology is all bells and whistles ... but no train.  Yes, the personal computer and the internet has changed the world.  No doubt about that.  Of course, as per usual, humanity has taken this technology and used it for ... what?  To become smarter?  Better educated?  More well-rounded?  Some have.  But most use computers and the internet to watch porn, keep abreast of their favorite celebrities, play time-waster games like Farmville, buy thousands of dollars of useless garbage and, worse still,  hole themselves up in their favorite echo chambers where their political and religious views can be vindicated and left unchallenged by differing opinions and points of view.  This gives them the illusion that everyone but a small rebel minority agrees with them.  I mean, everyone knows that the first human-like robots or androids will be used for sex.  


Thus when it comes to spaceflight and the colonization of even the moon much less Mars, Titan, or anywhere else beyond low earth orbit, is nothing but a pipe dream.  I know we're all supposed to be positive, upbeat, and hopeful about such things -- but I'm not.  Space tourism is a joke since it will simply be yet another plaything for a tiny fraction of humanity to enjoy -- i.e. those with ridiculous amounts of personal wealth in corrupt and compassionless economic and political systems -- while one person for every dollar spent dies of starvation or lack of access to health care.  I'm not a person who thinks we have to solve our problems here before going into space -- far from it!  However, the problem of greed, the insistance for near instantaneous reciprocity of financial investments, the culture in America that shuns those with high intellect and intelligence, and using spaceflight as just another tool to make a small cadre of people wealthy -- those problems **will** have to be solved if human feet are to ever leave earth again.  At least if those feet are to go any further into space than the ISS.  So much of humanity has seemed to have lost their wonderment of space;  teachers and scientists need to find a way to get it back.  Otherwise, we'll sit here and dream until our planet becomes uninhabitable by an ever-warming sun."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-04-26T00:46:50Z	UCHcLhpMPoRHhtJa1UR4yZMw	none		UgwrrCvd9zWVhhO1xrZ4AaABAg

What about the fact that the vast majority of UFOs that seem to be intelligent or under intelligent control seem to move in a non newtonian fashion.

"An idea I was mulling around was a tank lining that was kept hydrated by the water and also double as a seal or a kind of soft bladder. Not only would this let you keep the vital parts of your ship covered in a layer of water, but the lining could actively fight punctures by using the pressure difference. Instead of water leaking, it would be the thicker lining that would bulge out and dehydrate, possibly rupturing a cell structure in the lining that would force it to cure under a thermal reaction, using minimal water in order to cure and harden until maintenance could be performed, and it could be easy enough to replace small amounts of lost water with how abundant of a resource it is. I've always been a fan of bio-mimicry in technology and finding ways to replicate solutions based on nature. The lining and water would scab the wound like an organic body would and nanobots could patch it up with the hull material as it pulls away the scab, possibly leaving a scar over the spot.

The biggest conundrum I'm encountering is how to create a chemical computer that isn't grown or organic in nature, but functions like one. Seems like this step in technology would be a necessity in properly transferring a human consciousness in to a machine, since our brains don't have a programming language, so to speak, and instead communicate with chemicals. We can back them up with electronic hardware for information storage and the like, but it would have to communicate via chemical interaction rather than electrical in order for us to begin thinking about transferring ourselves in to one, right?"

"About how we change what we find cool or beautiful ... I agree.  One example is the Tesla cybertruck.  I thought is was ugly.  Within 3 or 4 days it really grew on me, and a week later I found it really cool and beautiful.  It made me wonder if beauty means anything at all?  Another example, some physicist spoke about the beauty of equations, because of things like symmetry, and had talked to a Japanese colleague.

Any ship interstellar man made will need to last in tens or hundreds or even thousands of years. So far human has not demonstrated that kind of capability as yet. So human would likely need to build some earth orbital stations to test all the designs for at least tens of years and then test the moving ships between earth and mars before really going into deep space with human on board. For that reason, a rotating design to generate gravitational environment probably need to be the whole ship. The current bearing mechanism would not last for that kind of time span, unless the moving parts are absolutely not touching each other. Can any magnetic bearing do air tight?

"This is the design of the spacecraft in my novel:


It is a passenger transport craft, with a back-swept delta-wing configuration. One wing contains a passenger seating area, the other, passenger cabins.
In the center is the main hallway, which contains the flight deck, situation room, infirmary, matter synthesis room, and the engine room at the back.
It has three decks: Deck 1 is the maintenance level, deck 2 is the main deck, and deck 3 is just a holographic planetarium / auditorium, and observation lounge.
It has a fully-pressurized cabin with artificial gravity; which makes sense for a passenger spacecraft. Air is filtered and recirculated; CO2 extracted.
The propulsion system consists of ion thrusters for maneuvering, fusion thrusters for terrestrial speeds, and a singularity drive for cruising speed."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2020-02-23T04:01:18Z	UC0N3bYnvI22HOS_OzoSMl-A	none		Ugxs5264t0Ahue1Xpdd4AaABAg

Yes and no, keep in mind that if you're blowing through an area at tens of kilometers per second relative to the stuff nearby, things on the side moving several meters a second can only bash into you if they were within spitting distance when you reached that spot, because you've gone by it so fast.

"Giving this some thought, and playing some video games with space ships, it seems to me few if anyone is getting the space ship design right.  Including NASA, Russia, and SpaceX.  Pilot should have heart at center of mass/gravity of ship, if uncontrolled axial rotation occurs, best chance of maintaining blood pressure and regaining control, at point of least acceleration and inertia.


Edit: Or is that a thing?  Now that I say it, I realize I am not sure, do they have the primary pilot situated this way?"	V4ddnrBT6hE	1	2020-01-13T04:48:13Z	UCX9EJ1xtAw6_H4_A7JbV_bA	none		UgzeRaydBedI1qZxEcF4AaABAg

At current rate of development, Computers might basically be able to emulate human brains by 2025. So as a thought experiment, have this spacecraft built and crewed with several simulations of human minds. Slowing down the computer clock would save on energy and slow down the crews perception, making them go faster than light in their own frame of reference. Now imagine you are one of these guys and you are just living your easy life inside some feel-well-simulation, then suddenly you are jerked from dreamland and projected to some android body to cope with fire or life-threatening malfunctions - that would be a hell of a nightmare!

"One thing that seemed to get glossed over, is relatively equal amounts radiation shielding will still be needed in the rear portions of a ship. Given ships will need to flip, for equal amounts of time, to properly decelerate. If this concept is sound (my knowledge base is admittedly a bit murky in this regard). Especially if a ship is more equally inhabited/accessible to the crew.


Also on the topic if big freighters, I feel the main concept was missed. Which is what Trains, 18 wheelers, and ocean haulers use. Mass transport of goods making up for the high cost to operate/maintain. Plus, super space freighters are going to be hauling far more than raw materials. Processed goods, luxury goods, unique goods only one planet produces (most likely Earth). If Cryogenic's becomes a thing, it will even allow for the transport of animals, plants, and other items that can survive being frozen. I also feel the concept of time was miss guided. In a civilization that is comfortable operating in space, time will become the same level of importance, as it is in modern economies. No one will want to wait years for a slow moving, smaller freighter, to arrive. A super freighter may take longer to accelerate, and lots of fuel, but given it will have room for a massive power plant, it will be able to reach speeds that will allow it to travel fast enough to meet demands. Plus the amount of cargo it can carry, will compensate for the costs. Plus some. 



That and supplying new colonies will likely end up an important task for more advanced super freighters. They may take proportionately longer to arrive, compared to smaller freighters, but will be able to bring exponentially more cargo. Thus helping to keep a colony alive longer/allow a colony to grow exponentially faster. 



Think of today's ocean ferrying, ocean haulers. They are the worlds largest ships, likely incredibly expensive to operate, yet are the way international trade is conducted. Without them, I am confident international trade would be crippled. If not outright destroyed. 



Now, a super freighter will only be possible/cost effective once a civilization reaches Fusion power, at least. Otherwise even if built in space, the cost of the fuel to propel such behemoths would be way to expensive."

"As a ten year old kid 1981,
I knew this nano graphene Tower Elevator idea to be a stupid idea... 
I knew that cars could use the energy if stored, when taken by alternators, when a car slows and brakes, 
I knew that compressed air was able to work in a light combustion car engine, 
I knew that the British had first invented the best fighter bomber of WW2 before the war but took almost half the war to put into production.
Which is why My brother and I started our better idea, that of an EARTH LIFTER program.. 
This program is based on being able to lift not just heaps of people, but Tonnes of material for the reason of Space station. 
The Size of the Space stations of course is what is the real concept and need, if we are both to stay near earth and keep excavating and mining till we have exhausted all the Space-stations possible needs and reliability questions  on capturing other resources with continued mining of Asteroids and gas from planets (Saturn) and large frozen planets, Uranus and Neptune etc.. 
This Space station would have to have all the productive and development, mechanization capability of Earth as well as Food growing, animal habitat, Monstrous storage facilities, entertainment, sporting facilities, computing, mainframe areas, personal living quarters, Intellectual property, libraries, sanitation - sewerage, rubbish sorting. Water filtration, Heating, air filtration and cleaning, Fresh water storage, Salt water storage, intensive farming animal habitats. and lots of people. Reactor rooms .
The Space Station will need to be very versatile inside as things will need to be moved around and sorted out. People will need to think compact and the best usage of room.. The outer hull of the Space station will need to be tough like Space rocks and have room to cushion or brace against the incoming object/s. The Space station may have to be like a Snake, with sections that move interdependently to avoid Rocks rather than move the entire Space station quickly and stop just for one tiny quick destructive rock..
The Hyperspace movement/travel would mean that the Space station may have to bulk up and travel as a parcel , rather than in its snake form/structure. It would need Shielding, both movable Structural and Ionic rebounding tech. 
it would need Many sorts of power, and engine plants, not reliant on one source."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-12-09T12:30:48Z	UChfJBItgVYKSP8BTRbjwLJA	none		UgyxsIYzkPuWcIeZkzh4AaABAg

"It's strange how selective his speech impediment is. In one sentence he can say ""long"" normally, but volume comes out as ""vowelume"". Both words have an O pronounced like ""ah"", but he can't do it for ""volume"". There must be some fundamental difference between the syllable ""on"" and ""ol"". It might be kind of like how the german z is pronounced like the ""ts"" in cats, but is tricky for an English speaker because ""ts"" is never at the beginning of a word (except for tsar or some other foreign loan word, which we normally just say as ""zar"") and needs a vowel leading into it even though we're clearly capable of making that sound.

I know a  way to go faster than light and keep you alive. No, joke people!   That you, could do it with a good size ship about 250 feet around and 32 feet in height, and go way beyond light speed. No space debris to impact your ship. You need two things, Gravite drive engine, plus a power source provide the energy you need.  The first part is easy and the second part would be made by the first part. I could get really deep into this. However, it would be the size of a really big book. Thank you for your time.

A comment about freighters....  Steel mills are frequently large, covering multiple square miles rather than acres.  In a steel mill, the iron is made in the blast furnaces then transported in brick-lined insulated rail cars, in liquid form, to the steel refining furnaces.  In normal processes, a railroad engine will haul the iron to the steel-making furnaces, especially if the iron needs to leave one facility and travel to another.  When the iron moves internal to a single facility, frequently the railroad people will just ensure that the rail switches are set properly and just give the liquid iron-containing rail cars a push.  At the right speed, they will slow down outside of the steelmaking furnaces and be retrieved by the local railroad engines.  This is standard practice.  The mass of the submarine cars (they look like small civil war era submarines) ensures that they can travel miles. https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.B3u5ojjg4OtIer3jVB2ycAHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&w=279&h=157	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-28T08:13:42Z	UCAgyAS5m5OkX9o-aNTfbW6A	none		UgwhvJuFY0_WTuKKmyR4AaABAg
"Somewhat of topic. I believe we humans have to prepare to build O'Neill Cylinders very soon.
At least build a prototype in L4 or L5 in the near future. 

Instead of using thousands of years trying to terraform Mars, it's way more cost effective to use asteroids to build megastructures, like O'Neill Cylinders.
That way, we'll have humans in more than one place. 

Btw. There are Lagrange points at Mars and Venus aswell. ;-)

I like how you talk about this. Space travel is extremely complex but as you constantly mention you don't need hyperphysics solutions in order to do magic things. It is about being really smart on how to use your environment (space) in your advantage and when to use really advance stuff when you need. Is the same as software programming. Why do you need unreal engine 90 to make a game if your game is focus on fantastic gameplay design (you just need ascii graphics and good retro programming skills) , you need unreal engine 90 if you want photorealistic graphics. I really like you stellar engines talks and a lot of your videos. Looking forward for more hard sci-fi stuff.

6:40 A spear-shape isn't necessarily optimal for total mass reduction.  A long thing ship will have long travel times between front and back, to the detriment of efficiency for resources and especially humans.

( I find the Brits using mee-thane, and I always chide them for it, telling them that they do not say MEE-THOD for method.)  Wikipedia says he was born in 1980 in Sebastapol CA.  He is a Kent State Graduate, and he works as an Asthabula Ohio Commissioner of some sort.  He served in the US Army at Fort Sill OK, but nothing says what his rank or MOS specialty was.

Your workers/crew can live and work on site for extended periods reduce addition trips back for to the asteroid.

"Physical note: there is no ""lift"" when you travel at relativistic speed, and no deflecting atoms by pointy nose. There is a drag, but it works differently. Cosmic particles don't bounce off you, because electron orbitals are too weak to deflect them. These atoms penetrate your hull until they hit some nucleous and split it, losing kinetic energy in this process. And those secondary nuclei eventually slow down the ship. So your cross-section matters, but your shape does not."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-18T16:18:37Z	UCCtXUofVcQy_aZrSHfeFdeA	none		Ugyi1t0fnw9HDkNW5UB4AaABAg

"The ship design is at this time based upon, wights and strength. 
Is there away around it ? Yes sort of.  We know that gravity function with gravity waves all waves know to mankind can be recreated ( radiowaves, micro waves asf) 
So we must create artificial gravity waves,  these than can be used for 1 g spacecraft's, by limited the acceleration time to 50.000 seconds to limited the speed .
Going to other planets is outside or solar system is stupid , it doesn't prevent the extinction of humanity since proton decay ultimately will end it all.
So here my view on mankind in space 
1. Return to the moon 
2. Build a permanent base on the moon 
3 start mining the moon for helium 3 the perfect fuel for in solar system travel and other materials such as gallium ( solar panels) aluminum ( construction) 
4. Use the moon materials to build a launch platforms on the moon 
5. Build solar operating factories ( these could be automate) 
6. Build a space station to orbit between earth and the moon and one between Mars and the moon 
7.next step is a station every 200.000 kilometers between Mars and earth the last station ( at mars fardesest) will send radiocontrol robots that repeat what is done on the moon 
8. Repeat step 6 and 7 for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune 
9 next we concentrate on venus and mercury 
10. Terraform venus using mercury to cool the planet ( carbon ice mining to launch in to venus atmosphere) this will take about 8% of the mass of mercury and take about 35 years why  venus and not mars? 
Four reason
1. The proximity to the sun will provide all the solar power we need 
2. The gravity of venus is around 88,7 % of that of earth 
3.venus is always closer to earth than mars aka shorter travel time equals less fuel equals less cost 
building a Dyson swarm around venus orbit is far cheaper than building one around earth's distance."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-18T14:39:56Z	UCf7h2cIR9-341twD7NkG73w	none		UgwzxYDf1jU2fcYz3kh4AaABAg

"19:43 
There's a lot of ways you could safely get around the problem of violent, sudden burns and maneuvers. The most ""IT'S THE FUTURE!"" way that, while not entirely practical, is utilizing electromagnetic anchors in the form of boots, gloves, ect. Have a strip on the hull that communicates with them several times a second and and soon as a burn starts automatically engage the electromagnet and lock (and of course you could make as many safeties as you wanted, like having it so you could ""walk"" on the hull or overrides). And if the power goes out, every crewmember could have something like a safety strap/watch that inflates to give you protection.

Another method could be to just always be tethered. Say have a safety vest that can double as a personal heater/cooler and utility vest that can run in cut-out channels all over the halls and decks. And like a seatbelt automatically locks and tightens with sudden acceleration. It sounds ridiculous, but if you've ever watch guys on high rise or suspension bridges doing work, they utilize a similar if not much more tedious system where they have two spring-latch tethers and whenever they move they always have to have at least one locked onto a wire. Even moving a couple hundred feet means you have to lock/release/relock hundreds of times. If you can just take your vest and ""plug"" into the ceiling and dictate how much give it has until there's sudden movement you could easily walk around without needing to do anything to it. And in case of sudden damage, so long as you're still connected to a part of the ship, you wouldn't sucked out. And the lines could even incorporate oxygen and/or electrical connections in case of emergency."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-18T14:15:26Z	UCpXlFb569l1Ckj8j7huwbOg	none		Ugzm0Z4yHItzHMR43s94AaABAg

"If we somehow manage to build a constant acceleration engine, then the whole idea of space ship orientation need to change. In most space ship designs we adopt what we already do with ships and aircraft, and with a long slim design we could imagine walking through a long corridor along the length of the ship, mowing forward in the direction the ship is traveling. But this would not actually work, we would need to flip everything, forget aircraft and ships, and rather imagine tall buildings, skyscrapers, where the engines is at the base, and spire is the front of the ship.

This would mean the direction of travel would be your up, so looking out the windows the earth you're leaving is not behind you, but below you. The planet you're moving towards is above you. And moving from the front to the rear of the ship would not be by walking through a long corridor, but rather traveling with an elevator just like they do in buildings.

The reason for this is the constant acceleration would also create a force pushing towards the rear of the ship. So, accelerating at 1G would create a backwards facing force equal to the earth gravity. So, if the ship was long with a corridor through the entire hull, standing at the front of the ship trying to walk to the rear would make you fall at 1G through that corridor, until you hit the rear wall. This is why you need to visualize this corridor as an elevator shaft you could fall down through instead. 

Naturally, going from A to B at a constant rate of acceleration, you'd eventually blast through that target solar system in no time, so halfway through your journey you would have to stop accelerating, flip the ship 180 degree and then do a 1G deceleration for the remainder of the journey. So, looking out the window, our sun is now above you, and the target planet is now below you. Yeah, and while doing this flip, everything will be weightless inside the ship. Imagine taking a bath while this happens.

That said, I don't see us building a constant acceleration engine any time soon. But who knows."	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-18T10:15:24Z	UCuAECY5OSCYCaPW5MptH6LA	none		Ugw0L00ZqHCWQRIUu7Z4AaABAg

Very interesting stuff, but I don't see how any of this will ever happen. There is no need for space habitation. If you took all humans on Earth (6 billion) and put them in dwellings at 20 persons per acre, the entire human population would fit into Egypt.(400,000 square miles) There is just an enormous amount of room for people on Earth. We don't use our land efficiently, but that changes as we continue to urbanize. If everyone in the world lived at New York City densities, (40 people per acre, yep, that's it!) all of Earth would fit into Spain (180,000 square miles). Which is less of a technical challenge, getting people to live in an orderly manner on Earth, or shipping a large portion of them into space?

Speech impediment. An insane amount less noticable than before, most of us don't even notice it when looking back at old videos once he gets past the closed captions part of the intro, but many also mistook it as an accent or dialect. I remember it bothered me for the first handful of episodes, and then it just faded into the background at some point and I've never had an issue with it since, especially once his videos shot to the top of my favorite channels list. Worst comes to worst you could just mute the audio and start some music playlist or just watch in silence, might seem like a lot of effort for a video but the amount of talent he has at explaining a concept is well worth it. Once you're hooked on that, you could ease yourself onto listening to the original audio and enjoy his audio editing talent as well, or stick with the mute button if it bothers you still, we all have our own preferences I guess. Have a friend who said they couldn't make themselves listen to it at first despite finding the content intetesting only to later say it makes an interesting podcast (an audio only media).

"1:18 I can't not talk about this hammer analogy. Firstly one has to make any hammer sent up heavier in almost every case, as it would need more mass to compensate for lower to no gravitational assist in it's use. Try nailing something in an inverted position vs. an upright position and you'll see the difference that working with gravity makes. Secondly a lighter hammer than the job calls for will not do. 

If one needs a hammer of certain weight and the people on the ground are saying ""best we can do is one of half the weight"" the person floating around up there might well respond with ""You know what... Fuck it. Don't even send a hammer at all, I'll use the heel of my shoe"". Try driving a framing nail with a finish hammer. It's doable. But not without far more effort and a lot more things going wrong (like a bent or broken nail due to more metal fatigue from having been struck many more times than the nail was designed to take).

I get that it's 'simple tool for simple example' and this is a low value nitpick. But that's just about the worse tool to make an example of in this way. An open end wrench/spanner is more the kind of tool that can be lightened without reducing it's effectiveness or falling short of necessary specs."

One great spaceship design would include a series of cylindrical habitats connected to motors behind and a shield of some kind in front of the cockpit. It would also have some kind of magnetic field around the main habitats, as well as maybe a light sail and laser for propulsion. This design would be excellent for long journeys to the outer parts of our solar system and to other solar systems.

"It's interesting to see what various scifi settings did and didn't think about, and the extent to which their fictional technology influences their design.

For instance, take Star Trek...
I'll use the Enterprise D for reference, since I know it's 'technical' design better than some others.

First off:
Scifi tech:
- Warp drive (FTL travel)
- Impulse drive (some form of fusion/ion drive, but with some 'mass reducing' FTL derivative tech included)
- Energy shielding (including matter and energy deflection/absorption, and specialised uses such as an air shield)
- Artificial gravity
- Momentum manipulating technology (tractor beams, inertial dampeners)
- antimatter power
- active support structures (Structural integrity field)
- transporters (moving matter from one location to another)
- Replicators (converting matter directly from one form to another, including elemental transmutation, but NOT direct energy to matter conversion.)

So, with all this unexplained technology we already eliminate a lot of common issues indirectly.

But even within the bounds of that technology, let's look at what the ship design takes into account:

Design problems accounted for:
- ship has a wide, but flat profile, with fairly smooth lines. (good for drag I suppose). This design is in fact claimed to have optimisations related to how FTL travel functions, which, in a setting where FTL travel is commonplace, makes sense; If your ship is going to be optimised for anything, it's your most common flight regime.
- Detachable saucer section; Ship as a whole isn't intended for atmospheric flight, but saucer by itself is intended for a one-off emergency landing on a planet with atmosphere.
- Defensive shielding; Primarily protection against enemy weapons, but serves a secondary purpose at low power output as radiation shielding and similar, and protection from various kinds of environmental hazards
- Structural integrity field; Active support that allows the ship to remain rigid and deal with larger applied forces
- Inertial dampening field: Dynamically adjusting field that compensates for inertial effects on the crew, allowing very large accelerations with little notable impact on the ship interior (especially for easily predicted acceleration forces)
- Artificial gravity, which avoids needing rotational sections or unusual structural deck plans, especially when combined with the IDF system cancelling out any large forces on the interior.
- Navigational deflector. The large dish on the front of the ship isn't just for show; And given that the ship can separate into two halves, yes, there is a secondary system for the saucer section if it needs it. Consists both of nested force fields spanning hundreds of kilometres ahead of the ship to clear small debris, as well as a high powered beam to deflect slightly larger objects (micrometeoroids). Anything larger is avoided through course corrections. (say a 1 metre rock or the like)
- Ablative armour on the hull to protect against less severe impacts that make it past all the energy shielding.

That already covers a fair bit of the most common things. Almost all of it is solved in a rather unrealistic scifi manner, but it IS something they thought about nonetheless, which is something praiseworthy in it's own right. (often designers and writers don't even think about it. So while a fairly nonsensical solution that has little in common with the real world isn't ideal, it's better than just outright ignoring the issue.)

There are some big issues though.
- Very low fuel quantities; - Even considering it's powered by a matter/antimatter reactor, the ship is something like 5-10% fuel by volume, and even less by mass. 
About 65,000 cubic metres of hydrogen slush with 3000 cubic metres of anti-hydrogen. Technically deuterium is used. But if we assume solid hydrogen at a density of roughly 86 kg/m^3 we end up with about 5,600 tonnes of Hydrogen and 258 tonnes of anti-hydrogen, on a ship with a total mass on the order of 4.5 million tonnes. Which makes the fuel load on the order of 0.02% of the ship's total mass. Regardless of what kind of magical propulsion system the ship might have, that doesn't seem likely to get you very far, much less the 7 year operational lifespan a full fuel load is claimed to have.
- maneuvering thrusters. Even if you handwave the impulse drive 'mass lightening' effect, to account for the low quantity of fuel, the maneuvering thruster system has no such benefit, as it appears to be a pure reaction mass based system, and I dread to think how quickly the ship would be out of fuel just from that alone...
- Lack of any notable thermal management system. Yes, background materials suggest radiators embedded into the hull. But it still doesn't seem anywhere near enough for a ship with that level of power output...
- very little in the way of supplies or manufacturing capability; Sure. Food replicators - that don't work in an emergency. Industrial replicators. Same problem, but can't reasonably cope with manufacturing critical components of the ship (warp coils for instance seem to have too much mass to reasonably be something you could replicate). There are spare parts on board, but the stock is extremely limited... Overall for a ship that should be capable of 7 years of independent operation, there's little in the way of supplies. Most of the ship in fact seems to be crew amenities.


There are more flaws, and more minor things accounted for.
The biggest surprises really are what IS something that was thought about, even if only superficially.
And yet so much of it doesn't make any sense...

I still believe that with the right set up your ship could have a defector shield in the front of it using Magnet tech. We already know enough about how magnets can have a North and South pole and field lines between them!  A electro-magnet system power by a generator and helped by solar power set up well could be lining the sides of the ship and making a magnetic field around the ship pushing any possible damaging objects away around your ship. just like the star trek ships have?  Not so sci-fi this idea as it is a real tech that just needs building right.	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-17T10:56:26Z	UCbNpJdmFiXJc5r29hu2Q2eg	none		UgymsTQpYm_aS0uqoYh4AaABAg

"In all seriousness, in dealing with critical systems, there is a saying - ""one is none and two is one"" with the suggestion that if you have critical system, you best have a couple spare elements. However, if you have a thousand critical components, you really don't need 3,000 'spares.' There is a pretty well developed and studied branch of engineering with the subject of deciding criticality of any component or factor.  As the efforts to go out into the solar system, there are already tested and mature ways to plan and decide these subjects that would be absolutely planned that affect how a vessel would be designed and executed."

I don't see the point in generation ships. It would be a lot easier to just store genetic codes in a computer database then synthesise cells a la Craig Ventner on arrival at the destination and grow them into new humans. Your ship can then be much more compact. The only ships where there will be any point in having live humans on board during the trip will be ones on short enough trips that a person who embarks at the start is still alive on reaching the destination. Who would want to commit their descendants to endless generations living in a flaky tin can?	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-17T03:05:57Z	UCim4gKPjQHzLkJnlLXyE8Gw	none		UgzQcyBWqw9bs0t_hC14AaABAg

I think your conclusion towards the end is most relevant: Any design will have to start with establishing the basic technology behind it. Sci Fi is full of empty cardboard thickness designs that do not take any considerations about energy containment / density / protection into account. In stead it is often assumed that the whole energy porblem will be solved with some magic wand trick. So to start with: Will something like the Mr. Fusion kitchen applience used to mod the Back To The Future DeLorean ever be possible?

"Larry Niven is one of the relatively few authors who considers the problem of loose objects in a ship without artificial gravity.  One of his early stories mentions that spacers who get messy have gone quietly suicidal.


There was an important detail about radiation shielding that was skipped over.  The wrong level of shielding can actually increase effective radiation dose.  Very high energy particles, charged and uncharged, tend to ignore relatively low-density stuff like flesh and zip through without interacting much.  If you have the wrong level of shielding, you can increase the effective dose by dropping this extremely hard radiation down to much more strongly interacting lower energy radiation.  If your shielding absorbed half the energy, but the remainder interacted ten times as strongly, you would have increased effective radiation dosage by a factor of five.  This is mostly a cosmic ray shielding problem.  Shielding good enough to protect you from solar flare radiation blasts makes cosmic rays much more dangerous.  This is why realistic treatments of radiation shielding in space (like how Zubrin proposes protecting crew from solar flares on Mars missions) usually have a 'storm shelter' to hide in during solar flares that has a highly protected small space that will protect you from solar flares but you stay out of otherwise because it increases effective cosmic ray exposure."

"The real fun only starts when you start to look at how appalling the design of most sci-fi spaceships is. 

Trying to look semi-realistically the biggest question is do you have FTL technology. I have tried to create a semi-realistic FTL tech for a sci-fi series I was working on, and came up with the idea for a competition among engineers to test how the ships from old sf would perform. Unfortunately for me I began to make the physics  model the thing was based on more realistic and my idea fell apart - because an FTL ship could be any shape - even a rubble pile. 

(Basically the FTL environment is too harsh for any ship made of matter to survive - spaghettification, savage radiation, and 'tachyon decay', plus dilation time stop. The solution was a completely folded bubble of space around the ship hiding it inside a micro singularity. The singularities expanded until they became the heart of the whole technology - a wormhole tunnel can hide the ships mass allowing to accelerate to the speed of light for free and a negative curvature allows it to go faster still..)"

The Bussard Ramjet, or ram-augmented interstellar rocket is something of an oldy. There's no reason to discard this concept because it's rather nice for cutting through any dust and pebble clouds when travel above half the speed of light. I don't suppose that doing a slow run through the galaxy is doable for anything alive, unless we are very very long-lived indeed. Yeah, we could do frozen sleep all the way through. What I am betting is that over the centuries we will develop the knowledge and means of doing FTL via wormholes. Yeah, the energy required appears ginormous, but it's like me asking in the 15th century how we could light Paris with electric lights? We'd have trouble even explaining it because we'd be burned as witches, because the Church fathers would disapprove.

"The ""Adrift on a Sea of Stars"" series talks about a lot of topics in your episode.  Nose cones with slopes armor, water as radiation shielding, air resistance as the starships hit the interstellar hydrogen at high speeds.  A lot of them travel bat 15% the speed of light because of the equivalent of a sound barrier at 17% C.  The mass of a craft doubles at 86% (as I recall) though the fasted (sub light) craft traveled 42% C.  That one had a large power budget and needed continuous firing laser cannons to atomize dist in it's path.  Worrisome as the same laser cannons made it double as a battleship.  Question.

"I may come over as a bit of a pedant here, but as we are talking spaceships I will risk the irony ;0)
First I think most of the graphics are cool (which is, I suspect, their main point) .......... but
Many of the ships incorporate spinning sections to give psudo-gravity, however the designer has not taken in to account centripetal forces!
The ones that have a stationary core with a rotating disc or cylinder round it would have a problem spinning the outer without also spinning the core in the opposite direction. Unless the spin is generated by gyroscopic effect you would presumably have a force spinning both parts in opposite directions. If your spin Is generated by using a large mass as a gyroscope and effecting motion relative to that ...... you need eather a Large mass or a great diameter (or both) to react against!
For those with multiple spinning rings you could use reaction of one ring against the next, but even so having a ""stationary"" core would not be easy!
My personal favourite was the ship with multiple groups of 4 wheels all spinning on their own and their spindles centre! Anyone who has been on the fairground rides knows how that one feels! It would Not be good for extended  (or even short) periods!
There is the added problem of course correction with them all. They would All act as gyroscopes and resist any course changes to their axis'. The ships would also need constant course correction to counter precession effects ..... unless you keep the spins constant And do not fly in a gravity well!
Compared to actually building any of them I suspect curing these problems would be relatively  minor ;0)"	V4ddnrBT6hE	7	2019-11-14T22:18:21Z	UCDkNp3Sw0V7nlMcCV68pWsQ	none		Ugw52hhc6vgkRdDUQUZ4AaABAg

When your engine emits high energy radiation it's a good idea to put a bigger distance between it and passengers quarters , so why not put your engine in front of the ship and attach living area from a long cable in the back of the ship, radiation decrease with the square of distance and a structural beam would be tens of time heavyer than a cable or ribbon for the same length.

"@Knoz that's incredible. All that techno babble sounds very nearly almost possibly maybe almost barely plausible.😀 Feels like we're just missing that 1 starting tech or exotic lement/ particle to make it all work. Like if we had anti matter.
 Ah well, of all the techs in Star Trek, the one that would have the most profound effect on our current world is Replicators. That ability to rearrange matter to any other matter. Its the base tech for transporters but even more so, it will solve our worlds resource limitations. Just imagine being able to recycle our billions of tons of garbage dumped into landfills each year. Now it serves as the raw matter that Replicators use to reshape into limitless food, rare (and expensive) elements which will drastically lower costs of R&D, Space travel (fuel is now free and limitless, as are the costly building materisls like  titanium gold for astronaut's visors, etc.

"I dispute your idea of a realistic ship design being boring. I inappreciate good looking ships as much as the next person, BUT for stories endeavouring to be realistic, knowing that a ship has been designed and portrayed realistically is far better for my suspension of disbelief.

And in being realistic, teach me far more than what stylized Sci-Fi has ingrained into me. Stylized Sci-Fi ships can be great for stories in their universes if portrayed and thought out well, but more realistic ones can help teach as much as they entertain. We need more depictions of such Sci-Fi ships as you talked about. For stories and to show us the future we can build towards.

"17:26 Thank you for pointing out that artificial intelligence is a rather vague term. To me it is a marketing buss word used by MBA s that consider any practical application of statistic not covered in their first semester of ""statistics for dummies"" magic.

No doubt we have amazing algorithms that yeald spectacular results. But calling it intelligence implies too much.
I would like to call AI ""stupidity avoidance algorithems""

I have seen it in production optimisation a lot. Put more automation into an assembly line and it will produce product faster, cheaper and of  higher quality.
BUT, if a minor unforsean change ocoures it will produce scrap faster with more catastrophic results than the un(der)automated assembly line ever could. 

And believe me there are always unforeseen circumstances. And when these occur you need an engineer to get the line up and running again a simple technician could fix an unautomated set up cheaper and faster but not your AI assisted technology wonder. 

The problem with interstellar voyages is time. How do you get an human engineer to sign up for a century long voyage where he might have nothing to do until the ""unexpected circumstances"" arise?

I think you would have a full complement of humanlevel (or higher) ""intelects on board. When the time arises you would boot up one or more of those ""intelects"" possibly first one to decide who to boot up.

Hard enough to explore our own solar system. The energy required for galactic missions would be immense...so using our biggest source of power-our Sun- would be logical.  I propose a huge orbital solar mirror array around the Sun.  Each mirror would be locked onto the target of exploration, creating a super-concentrated beam of sunlight for a solar sail powered spacecraft to harness and follow.  Now you figure out how to slow down and land.😁	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-14T19:46:32Z	UC0sMejhpl60lMWnQhdbNkHg	none		UgySbR7_wFAasQlJCHh4AaABAg

"As pointed out in Niven's Belter stories and Card's Ender's Game, spaceship design will be dependent on the designers internalized spatial orientation. People raised in a gravity-free environment will grow used to seeing the world on a three dimensional gird as regards not only visual input, but also potential motion and trajectory. People on the surface of a planet don't ordinarily think of up and down as potential trajectories in most circumstances; in zero-G, they are just as viable an option as any other.
It's difficult to quantify the effect this difference in orientation will have on design, but it will certainly be profound, and makes any predictions about ship design highly contingent at best,  and meaningless at worst. We simply don't know what such people would view as efficient or desirable."	V4ddnrBT6hE	1	2019-11-14T19:18:29Z	UCUcT2D-pZU4kahrFSPxBS9w	none		Ugx3SbWbR7L8dEP9sYd4AaABAg

"At 1:21, the solution is simple. Design a reasonable spacecraft with decent margins from off-the-shelf components- then launch the propellant separately. For missions leaving LEO, as much as 80% of the mass in LEO is propellant. If a tanker launch fails, dispatch another bird.

While custom hardware can eliminate those half-penny resistors, the fact that it is a custom design injects a hundred *new* bugs that have to be expensively hunted down and fixed. If your electronics stack is large, redundant, and varied- with multiple systems from different vendors capable of doing the same tasks- two boards from two different vendors would have to fail to cause loss of mission. 

Yes, this makes for a heavier spacecraft. Screw it, make the tanks bigger, launch them empty, and top off the fuel later. Install two or three small main engines, accept the need for multiple burns to depart LEO, and get on with it."

If energy is not a problem, then constant acceleration would be possible, and if they built ships looking like cars, then the front of the ship would be the roof, and the wheels would be the rear. Looking through the windshield, you would be looking out the side of the ship. You could make the front of the car the front of the ship as well, but at constant acceleration at say 1G, you would feel like lying on your back with your feet in the air, falling through the rear window of the car if you were to roll of the seat.

We are making algae that is way more efficient at the process. Some molecular biologist made the process 60% more efficient. Now the problem is getting enough CO2 to the algae to keep up with the rate it can photosynthesize. 
I see further improvements we can do with the chloroplast. Including using different electromagnetic catalysts (like using infra red instead of visible light). If we can pull that off we could have tanks of algae sitting ontop of processors/engine components producing oxygen and organic chemicals at a high enough rate, and a small enough space to be considered a passive solution."

Maybe you can help explain to people that if we are seeing UFO's it means they aren't dangerous. The cost to send one ship over here compared to thousands, why would they send thousands of ships if they don't know if the mission would be successful in the first place. One ship can easily hit the planet with an asteroid to cause some destruction and test our defenses for almost no cost at all.

An alternate version of aerogel have been developed that is much better at stopping radiation...

I disagree that it would be more advantageous to push around bodies instead of cutting materials and storing inside a freighter: a freighter and its mining procedure can be standardized and mass produced, while pushing around celestial bodies requires a new project every time, each time exposing you (aka your crew and your profit) to new errors and possibly injuries and those both are added costs	V4ddnrBT6hE	0	2019-11-14T16:54:19Z	UCxV8JKEiRLtQacIW11PkTUg	none		UgwXv6SzDD0dzsS6q0Z4AaABAg

"Another outstanding episode. I can't believe I got here while there were still less than a thousand likes, I don't think I've ever been so early before.

On an unrelated note (unrelated to this specific episode, not unrelated to this channel), I am trying to come up with a specific scenario for space warfare to wargame out. I realized that how wars are conducted depends very much on the goals of the war, so I need to figure out what the objectives would be. The problem is that it is almost impossible to come up with a plausible scenario when all of the beligerants are post-scarcity. I need to find a situation in which there is some form of scarcity that can, at least in some limited circumstances or consistent with some ideology, can be more readily solved with force than with trade.

I've considered an interstellar war in which two parties starting from different systems of origin attempt to colonize the same system and try to wipe each other out out of racism (since each may have spent enough time in isolation from each other to have evolved away from each other). The problem is that I can't find much historical precedent for wars being started out of racism alone. Racism makes wars far more brutal, and is often integral to the propaganda, but there is usually still some sort of economic driver. And unless one of the colonizing parties was centuries ahead of the other there should be plenty of room in the solar system for both of them from an economic standpoint."

​@Augustus Bohn Perhaps if there is some valuable resource that is rare enough that, in the solar system in question at least, it is only present on one world. In which case any faction that wants access to that resource would be forced into competition with each other. I'm not sure what that resource could be though. Even the rare stuff seems to be pretty abundant on the scale of a solar system. The only exception I can think of might be something produced by some local life form which doesn't exist anywhere else because the life form that produces it doesn't exist anywhere else.

Like airports have procedures and protocols to mitigate damage when something unplanned happens, I'm sure spaceports will also have space-flight controllers. You would never make a heading directly into your destination, but slightly to the side. After you're cleared, you diverge to your docking area.

It seems to me that the apparent Fermi Paradox indicates that useful controlled fusion is not possible.  Also, Life, as a complex dissipative structure in a far from equilibrium system needs gigatons of materiel to be viable, long term.

Only going to cause more reasons for wars.   Flags are useless.  An excuse to fight over what....nothing.   Once more people evolve...we won't have but one flag.   That could be closer then expected.  People everywhere are getting choked with the government .....failures.... revolution is brewing....in a lot of places.   Anybody putting a flag up should think to themselves.  what exactly am i supporting?   Some loser then is only in it for cash.   That is basically what most of us call a leader these days.   The leaders look at us as votes.  Say whatever BS they need to say to get in office..... and then do absolutely nothing about the problems.  Some of them make the problems worse.

"No. 
Man will never go to Mars - not in 50 years anyway. 
I mean, i see the furture is coming at us really fast with Moore's law and euv lithography, and it is very exciting, but most os what folk believe about space travel is based on hoax. 
And then folk are keen to keep up the hoax, so that there kind of rules out any moonlandings or Mars trips. 
In other words, before any Mars trips we must first disavow ourselves from the Apollo hoax. 
It is increasingly difficult to maintain ideas of Cold space, or 4k space, as people gradually become more exposed to the reality of satalite tech. 
At the moment we have students of satalite design who have no idea about the ambient temperature of sunlight in space.(it's 120°C). 
How can anyone design circuitry without knowing the heat of the environment of the working plant?
Also radiation is gradually becoming more relevant to more technology in space. At some point we will need to move on from the Apollo religion and just start admitting the truth. 
It was all a big hoax. 
And it wasn't a patriotic thing, that was just a smoke screen. It was more a national shame for the country that called itself the USA."	VQY3qWZMIl8	0	2020-03-10T03:47:45Z	UC-qosgiTvySVmR3botZECUA	none		UgwQbZn_Jk0m1g8t91Z4AaABAg

it is impossible to have atmostphere in mars like we have on earth. because of 1 thing. size.. even though mars rotate almost the same speed as earth, it is too small to create same gravity as earth. gravity is the one trapping the atmosphere so that it will not go out in space. by the way, id ont know what exactly the theory now about the gravity. but as per my own theory gravity or pulling of matters towards mass is a product of speed  of spinning and mass or size of the planet/star etc that is spinning	VQY3qWZMIl8	0	2020-03-07T10:15:29Z	UC4fez-0NkMsscHTNkLJXYnw	none		UgxPpwYVjKRL44KrIUt4AaABAg

The thin atmosphere on Mars makes flight difficult for both winged craft and balloons, but I would still think a dirigible style craft would be more capable.  Not nearly as maneuverable, obviously, but still better for it's potential surface area for flexible solar panels, and limited power requirements for long term observation.

"It is nice to dream of “colonizing mars” or even other planets and exoplanets. However the reason cited such as “overpopulation”does not wash.Whenever we speak of “overpopulation” we rarely refer to countries with a high population density such as Japan, but to poor African countries in countries like Africa. If we consider overpopulation” is about poverty and lack of resources rather than “population density “ in number of people per square km (Is Japan “overpopulated”)then how do we expect poor countries to pay for atrip to mars?It would be much cheaper for poeple to build skyscrapers, go underground, under the sea, or even populate “hostile” places like Antarctica.Living in antarctica is a picnic compoared to living on mars.

With people living on skyscrapers,underground , under the seas or in antarctica there would be much more land freed for agriculture to support several times the world’s current population.

So you think living in antarctica , under the sea, underground and on skyscrapers would be “expensive” and beyond our means? Well going to mars has its own benefits which have nothing to do with the “population problem”.However colonizing mars is NOT a solution to current population problems which have more to do with poverty and politics rather than population density per  se."

happy new year. - I have been thinking that if we were to colonize Mars and create an atmosphere, we would have to, in order to hold on to the oxygen, create a magnetic field there. The sun has a giant magnetic field and since magnets affect each other, a magnetic field on Mars would be affected by the sun and create a significant imbalance in the solar system. Is that common sense in that regard. That alone will make the project impossible. Kind regards from Denmark.

The fact that we would use less resources might not be true though, as we would firstly use a lot of rocket fuel and build large rockets using Earth's resources. Secondly, we would also expend resources on building things for the colonization of Mars. Remember, rockets not only have to carry the load of people, but also equipment for the colonization of Mars, as well as things like parts for houses.

"I have looked at a lot of videos about colonizing the moon & Mars. And I haven't found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.

The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. 

After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  

This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.

We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.

"There's nothing that says these people have privacy, or, alone time. Seems Mars is going to be a prison for probably it's first 100 to 200 years. 
I do not rep( intentionally) other people on this. But would you volunteer to live in prison? Many people in prison lack the ability to stop themselves from memorizing other people's ways, patterns( with an intention behind it), and manipulating that information.

Also we need  to start terraforming mars we need a mirror the size of Lake Michigan covering the poler ice caps to melt it releasing gasses then it will make mars have a thicker atmosphere and will have air pressure than start making factories that produce large amounts of oxygen and nitrogen and carbon dioxide over the course of a century	Gcnf5BdLXxw	0	2020-07-25T17:33:23Z	UCQZzgZKCT4Kw9_KzEDTcPyA	none		UgzY4lawWIC4CaI4V6x4AaABAg

Massive colonisation of another planet is just impossible right now. And we have just no need in it. Maybe in 2000 years, after a couple of atomic wars. And the first thing to do will be to explore the nearest asteroid belt to gain rare resourses. The recourses should be used to built space automatic forges. These forges, in their turn, should build giant spaceships, that will contain almost all infrastractural needs for humanity to colonise another planet. This is a HUGE work, that will demand an effort of all the humankind, not just one country. And such work is possible only then, when we will have to deside: whether we unite or die. Nowadays we are able to send on Mars several astronauts or cosmonauts or taikonauts in order to fulfill someone's ambitions to put a flag there first and die. The best option now is to build as much robots as possible and send them to every possible interesting corner of our solar system to gain information and process it on Earth.

Okay video, but there are something wrong in the basic. We will here at earth get a big problem with overpopulation and pollution in THIS CENTURY, we are in no way ready to colonize Mars or anything else. Even if we move 1 milion people to Mars, there will still be 7800 millions people back here at earth, we would not be able to measure here at earth, that we colonized Mars.

You lost me when you said forests are being cut down at an alarming rate. If you don’t know that forests are flourishing in the US then you don’t have anything to say that I can trust. All industrialized countries have trouble maintaining their populations and all indications are that as less developed countries become more developed their populations will also stop growing.

How stupid. The planet is not overpopulated. Have you ever flown transcontinental over the US. It is almost 100% empty land - not cities. Do the same with South America, Africa, The Arctic, The Antarctic, Australia, etc. 

YUP! all of it is NEARLY EMPTY!! We could grow our population at the same rate as now for a thousand years and not fill up all that land.

Note: 

There is no such thing as man made global warming. 

Thus, mankind has no control over the Earth's Climate. As far as ""climate change"" is concerned the climate has been changing since the earth was first formed and will continue changing (on its own) long past the days when mankind is long forgotten. When you add all that to the fact that plants and trees and, thus, animal life (who eats and otherwise consumes plants and trees) thrive, the more Carbon Di-Oxide they consume, you begin to see that the Earth was designed for much higher quantities of CO2 than we currently have. Thats because there were many times in history when the Earth had a much healthier plant infrastructure than it does now or has had for the past few thousand years.  (For example, the very healthy plants and giant conifer trees the dinosaurs consumed to get as big as they were.)

Although this is a good video in many respects, it does not do credit to the technology we already have. As I pointed out recently on my channel, we already have a transportation breakthrough. One over half a century old. Nuclear Thermal engines. We actually designed a vessel, the Copernicus, powered by three of these engines, designed to traverse the distance from Earth to Mars in a mere 100 days. What stopped us was not technology, but idiot politicians who decided that it was too expensive and that waging war in Iraq was a better idea.  Had we not canceled this program, we would have landed humans on Mars in 2018. I'm not kidding. This technology dates back to Von Braun and the Saturn V.  What has prevented us from exploring Mars and establishing a colony is a lack of will. All of the technology already exists.

Let's first apply our mind to the very initial reason we want to colonise another planet (Mars) - the fact that we have overly populated planet earth and almost succeeded in destroying it. Why don't we try to fix that mess first even if we are able to colonise Mars. Let's just agree that humanity doesn't necessarily have right to do as we please with everything in the universe and around us. If we were a bit less selfcentered, the rest of creation would be at peace - we just don't know why things exist the way they are. We must agree we are such destructive creatures our ambitions need to be curtailed. As to how and who does the curtailment, let's apply of mind.

I liked the vid even if a little weird, but it was mostly accurate. (1) We weather Elon or anyone else wants to admit it, we MUST colonise the moon first. Like baby steps, one foot in front of the other. Getting below the surface of the moon will be essential and then mine the very raw elements that are there (theorised) so we can process them and use the finished product for building very large space stations that can travel to Mars or other planets in this solar system. The moon is the jumping off point to everything because it is the easiest to get to from here. (2) Other worlds in this solar system are bound to have raw resources that very well may yield the answer to a great many engine, shielding, communications needs we have to travel further, faster, stronger than we are ever going to be able to not exploiting those planets as well. So it will be a learning curve for us as a species. If we can master the challenges of the worlds right here in our solar system, it would give us a better chance at surviving the challenges away from this system we call home.

"Look at all the 'things' in this vid that have somehow been transported to Mars. Remember, a basic Mars colony doesn't produce much of anything except human waste; everything else has to be brought from Earth. So we need to load up massive space ships and haul everything to Mars orbit, and then get it to the surface of the planet intact and still functioning. And then there's this: Mars is a harsh environment. That equipment is going to break down and need to be replaced. All of THAT has to be brought from Earth too: can openers, circuit boards, building materials, tools ... whatever. Setting up a factory(s) on Mars that would be able to produce everything (or even much of anything) needed by the colony would be almost a practical impossibility. Mars Colony One would not be like Jamestown/Plymouth was in any real sense. Virginia was similar to England; Mars has little in common with Earth. Getting supplies from England to the east coast of America was not really that difficult or expensive. From planet Earth to planet Mars? Way more expensive and difficult. And consider this: the New World sent stuff back to England that was highly profitable. Mars Colony would send nothing back to Earth but information. How valuable would that information be? Hard to say.


But, moreover, why would we want to expend such a massive effort to do this? To advance humanity to the 'next level'? Seriously? The projects presently planned to get people to the surface of Mars are being done just to provide a 'vacation spot' for rich people who can afford the price of the ticket. No private company is going to be interested in building a scientific research station on Mars just to do basic planetary science. Why would they? Financially it's a loser from start to finish. Would any government want to pay for such a boondoggle using taxpayer money? Apparently, the answer is yes. The US really is planning to do just this because it is somehow our 'destiny' to reach the stars. 


But if it's the 'destiny' of intelligent life in the universe to 'reach the stars', why have none of them ever done that in the entire history of the universe? We look out and see absolutely no evidence that our galaxy (much less the entire universe) has ever been the home of a galactic-wide civilization. Shouldn't we stop and think why that is?


Mining/extraction of raw materials from the asteroid belt might make some sense economically. But only if we can somehow get those materials to orbiting factories around Earth or the Moon at some reasonable cost that justifies the expense of creating such an infrastructure. It could even be economically practical to get certain rare and expensive materials such as diamonds, gold, platinum and other scarce elements sent down from the belt to Earth itself. But a colony on Mars? Again, why?


[Just as an aside, think of someone (or corporation) planning to spin asteroids down to the Earth for the raw materials. Ok, here comes a mile wide chunk of iron racing toward the Earth that they are somehow going to get down to the surface without destroying all life on the planet. What could go wrong?]"	Gcnf5BdLXxw	0	2019-12-26T18:47:18Z	UCH2UhY2Bkq2FOkgqEKv8OrA	none		UgxzDHIy715bQxVKUrp4AaABAg

Chances are that because we are already advancing ourselves into outer space, we will continue to move forward with the idea of colonization of other planets, inspite of the inherent dangers that such an adventure poses. We are naturally disposed to attempt the impossible, at the risk of endangering our own lives. We don't ask, should we do it, we just go ahead and do it, again and again and again, till someone makes a breakthrough for the rest of us to follow. It's better than going to a  war party and killing off thousands or millions of our fellow human beings.	Gcnf5BdLXxw	0	2019-12-10T07:17:20Z	UCIs0KWVbtIKCaHc6BSC_M0Q	none		Ugy8S7_hFP7jbkEduQB4AaABAg

"While I'm all for space exploration I just don't understand this obsession with ""colonizing"" another planet. Lets put it into context... Earth is pretty much just fine as it stands, but the idea is that over time we could mess it all up so we need to consider a new home planet. The issue is if we can't keep Earth in good shape and it's actually MEANT for us to live on, how can we live in a bubble on another planet that has countless *new* reasons for us to die?


We're talking about lots of things to deal with, from lower or higher gravity breaking down our bodies, radiations, being closer or further to the sun, magnetic fields vastly different than Earths... The list really does go on and on and all these things can kill us. 


How about doing the much easier thing of fixing out behaviors on Earth before you take all these bad behaviors to another planter that you can't even walk around out side on..."	Gcnf5BdLXxw	0	2019-11-20T20:08:32Z	UCicHhh3TF6XtSjbqVUsgf4g	none		UgxBLH151hD5L977sSV4AaABAg

"Making ww3 the first planetary war in away.

Civil war then world war, and colonies in space? No to colonies.

World war then civil war, and colonies in space? Yes for colonies in space.

World war, and no civil war, colonies in space? Yes colonies in space, and somewhat making it a planetary war.

Like how the first world war is a world war because of colonies."	Gcnf5BdLXxw	0	2019-10-15T02:53:41Z	UCeI7c8A582V5Bnmu74uWNGw	none	Ugzt56IOwWGFfd8nnh94AaABAg	Ugzt56IOwWGFfd8nnh94AaABAg.905MCizz9DK905MqTWxINc

Robots and AI are the key to make space colonization wayyyy easier for humanity. If you can build and prepare the environment on Mars from Earth  with robots, when it is ready sending people there will be less scary. And AI is just the next level we need so we can let it prepare everything beforehand without humans interface (mistakes).

One big reason we cannot start space colonization is because the west is so PC/Humanity brainwashed. They are not like their forefathers who would risk their lives traveling to the unknown without assurance that they can return back. So the cost designing space ship increases for back and forth missions. And also instead of Hiring Qualified engineers/scientist, they Want DIVERSITY  even if that person is not knowledgeable or qualified! Meaning they want people based on Humanity/PC/morals instead of SCIENCE and Facts. They thought they are God or in a Fiction Movie.

Because Mars doesn't have the magnetic shield we have on Earth that protects us from cosmic radiation.   Why, because the planet doesn't have the moltent core needed for a magnetic shield.

Beautiful, rich visuals, best i saw in videos of this kind so far :). Though I can't agree on the technology part. Tech is the last thing that we are lacking. First and formost, we don't have a Cold War anymore to fuel the space race :(.

When people tell you, they are going to Mars, they are lying to you. Mars is generall pain in the backside. First, their is not enough air to breath, so even if there was oxyen, the pressure would be to low, but there is enough air, to be a ruin everything. There is no magnetic field on Mars, so you will have to have shielding, just to not die of radition. The ground is poisonous, and always will be. It's at the bottem of a gravity well, so just to drop a few men off, and lift off the surface again, you would need a whole civilization. You could find a way around all this stuff, except, if you did, you just build a space station. The upside of a space station is, you don't have to deal with an atmosphere.  There are gravity stable spots all over the solar system, called L5 locations. There is one near Earth that's four hundred thousand mile wide. Four hundred thousand miles? Holy carp, we could put  the whole human race in that, and we would get lost. The worst reason for going to Mars is, it will always be a few days away. The human race would be like the donkey chasing the carrot hanging from a stick. We would run, and run, and never get there. The second worst reason for going to Mars is, it's a bad idea, but great excuse for a worse Idea. The world's powers want nuclear rocket ships, so we can zip around. One nuclear rocket ship would be like a hundred nuclear accidents happen the  whole time it's in operation. We could have a space presence in an Earth L5, and L4 location, and it would be so close, you could spend the  weekend on Earth, and go back for the weekday.  Mars is just a lie, meant to lead humanity around by the nose.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-10-19T11:22:21Z	UCaA-WWcxeNdq1VqRTbrFo5A	none		UgzjqkLyLXmqNzfh8VF4AaABAg

@Purvanya Tyagi So, G forces would be minimal due to the slow acceleration. Keep in mind that over time, this is an extremely fast engine, but it does not reach full thrust instantly, unlike chemical engines, instead, over a span of days. so g forces are not a concern. To answer your other question, deceleration is a bit trickier, a possible solution is flipping the vehicle over, so that the engine faces your destination, and then decelerating to a reasonable speed by turning on the engine again over a time span of days. Hope that answers your questions!	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-12-06T20:18:00Z	UCXrLMhVLTjuBodS0MzyPoJQ	none	Ugy2jesIAbbWrGLm_Wl4AaABAg	Ugy2jesIAbbWrGLm_Wl4AaABAg.9CSToXscz9e9GwYcxNTCon

The problem is achieving thrust of any kind in a vacuum doesn't work. When you apply force to any physical object with mass you receive equal but opposing force back, when you apply a force/thrust/ propulsion to nothing, nothing happens. You could never accelerate or slow down. Same is true for sound/communication transmission, sound waves require a medium to travel through.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-06-09T04:51:04Z	UCG9EgXlau5zm-zwBb1qhXog	none		UgwVXEgMPS0mi7KA0VB4AaABAg
"@chris trull Rocket engine doesnt push against nothing, it creates thrust using the mass of the fuel that is combusted in the combustion chamber.
""In a rocket engine , fuel and a source of oxygen, called an oxidizer, are mixed and exploded in a combustion chamber. The combustion produces hot exhaust which is passed through a nozzle to accelerate the flow and produce thrust. For a rocket, the accelerated gas, or working fluid, is the hot exhaust produced during combustion.""

Or get to mars in under 60 seconds using zpe tech which btw forms it's own ionosphere capable of deflecting spacejunk. A secret project insider exposed a black project on his deathbed confession to reveal there are craft that can run to Sirius B in just 15 minutes. That's nearly 6 trillion miles away, vs Mars which is only about 177 million. The craft's ionosphere bends into a teardrop shape, squeezing through space propelled by neutrino pressure. Electron neutrinos travel near the speed of light they think. That doesn't mean a sailboat's speed is limited to the speed of the wind, since in this case it would relate to a relative air pressure of that strong enough to keep atoms from flying apart.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-02-07T20:17:43Z	UCMynpYBvnpweZaz3teLvCSA	none		UgyO3yNFjE07LjVpXY14AaABAg

"O.K. ... So ""we"" use this ""engine"" to put ""men"" ON Mars (not merely in orbit around the planet)
What then? How do they get back to Earth? 
A ""chemical engine/rocket"" would be needed for lift-off there, just as it is here.
How many tons of fuel (Hydrogen or whatever) is needed for each leg of the trip?

Would the folk sent to Mars be able to handle Earth's gravity if they are able to return?
At least 8 months of 0 gravity would affect weaken their bones and muscles.

"@Hydrochloric Acid _""the rockets combustion chamber is in contact with the exhaust gases""_
Yes, and?
Thrust is a mechanical force, so the *propulsion system must be in physical contact with a working fluid to produce thrust*


""To accelerate something, there needs to be a force from the outside. For a car accelerating from rest, the only thing acting on it in the forward direction is the friction due to the ground
The trick here is that the tire is pushing back on the road, so the road must automatically push forward on the tire. This is Newton's 3rd law. Once you think about it, you'll see lots of examples of friction pushing things forward as they push backward"" - physics weber edu



_""just look at a jet engine next time you board a plane""_
I thought the thrust from a jet engine was produced mostly via the compression of air!
Thus, the working fluid to produce thrust is the air.

How do jet engines work?

Go back to the stone age.
The military have space crafts that fly in a 30 minits to the moon .
American citizens are being lied to from Nasa and the Military.
Russia working als with aliens and tey tell it not to the people .
Because its all about the high tech what tey have from aliens not ther selfs.
With the high technologie that russia gave and America and china good we make a better world with no war..
But people are not smart and we going to be stupid.
We have the jungle forrests that   are be distroyd by people .

If we distroy all animals and fish in the sea we can better be dead.
We have stil notting learnt from the people that have rule the earth for billions of years .

People that make war are not good in there head .
Look to Big America with there secret space ships tey tink I am the strongest on this earth and in space. 
Its not tru there are space ships     from America but tey are not the big boss in space and never by.
There are a galactic space command aliens that fly in or solar system to hold the peace and the space toys that America have is notting against the alien space ships.
When world war III breaks out governments  with ther famaly go's mile's  deep underground to safe ther selfs .
But you can not hide for jezus hi  know  that people Go Underground with the military .
But jezus will destroy them .
Hi have promesed that only the peolple that he have chosen will survive and if you are very deep in earth you wil also destroyd.
Thats a good ting you now.
How many times you tink the people on this world will be destroyd its not to tell each time when we are advanced round 3600 years the peopl of earth wil be distroyd.

Hypothetically, we could combine VASIMR engines w/ chemical engines. Our shuttles use both, liquid fuel (kerosene) AND solid fuel (APCP). The solid rocket boosters use the APCP, but what if we used radio waves similarly to the VASIMR to ionize the kerosene (which is ACTUALLY rocket fuel, even though an average joe can buy some) into plasma immediately before we combust it? That’d give a big kick, so we’d be able to take/need less fuel and, thus, make the craft lighter. It’d take a lot of energy to plasmafy the kerosene, but they should have a capacitor bank specifically dedicated to take off energy.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2019-08-09T08:51:54Z	UC6sAs614mLnTmRIDOttItMw	none		UgylQ47Bjpp6dz_aSah4AaABAg

"As far as I understand, SpaceX could send any reasonable payload on a one way trip to Mars even today, using a Falcon Heavy rocket. They demonstrated this capability with sending a Tesla Roadster into the Asteroid belt (they missed Mars orbit, but still). 

When BFR aka Super Heavy Starship is ready (2021 probably), SpaceX will be able to send big payloads to Mars plus a return trip for the Starship. If they dont't hold back on the trotthle and planets are positioned well, the one way voyage could take 4 to 5 months.

"The VASIMR  Engine has great potential and as this guy explains it and its potential while pointing out its negative issues there are solutions that he likely doesn't understand or know about with existing technology some even as old as the fifties. 

First using the Heavy Lift Falcon rockets to bring the pre-built parts of the VARIMR Space Craft into high orbit first using the ISS International Space Station to build an assembly staging space dock and ship yard framework enough two space craft. This way the ship would not need all that chemical rocket fuel etc. all that weight can be saved.
 Second meanwhile smaller versions of the VASIMR Craft could be sent to Mars ahead loaded with various types of robotic drones both on the ground and flying even as autonomous swarms working to gather the materials to build the first habitats and organize pre-placed resources which is the smartest and safest way to prepare for human exploration. Of course this all is done in stages over a period of a few years especially if this engine design pans out. The Space X  Dragon control module with an extended cargo pod with a smaller VASIMR engine could be used as a cost effective system to transport these supplies and robotic workforce. 

Also a permanent communications and control satellite system needs to be placed in orbit around Mars to enable near instantaneous communication between Earth and Mars which a temporary micro satellite is being used for the recent Mars Lander project I forget the name of it right now. 

 The narrator states that the VASIMR Engine requires a large power supply to create enough energy to power the plasma reaction, this is true and a nuclear powerplant would likely be the best option, however he shoots it down calling it ""dangerous"" which first off is not true we have very safe reactors now but we arent using a reactor to power a city but a space craft which there is a reactor system that was created back in the fifties that was all but forgotten and lost to time. An improved modernized version of the THORIUM REACTOR could be developed for use ins space and be as safe and clean as a small dental XRAY machine. 

 All of these challenges when really thought out and are not insurmountable or impossible, it is how we got to the moon back in 1969!!!! With a slide rule and pencils and paper all we need are people with the right vision and the right stuff to work together and we as curious ever inventive human beings putting aside our differences for a common goal can do ANYTHING! 

The more we work on a a challenge and create the more we find better easier cheaper ways to do the things we need to do to make our world our lives better all we need is a dream a challenge a goal and some idiots that say it cant be done and we silly humans will prove them wrong every time!

@Emir Latinović No, no, no. You said you understood. If the plasma touches the walls of the engine, it is quenched immediately. Even in the Tokamaks, which achieve temperatures 10 times higher than the VASIMIR, the engineers work hard to keep the plasma from contacting the walls of the torus or everything shuts down because the plasma cools immediately. Remember, the plasma is hot but diffuse.	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2019-06-03T18:30:21Z	UC-DyNBpnmaW1y2Sw-sv00vw	none	UgwmRELBiEHG7Bp7D554AaABAg	UgwmRELBiEHG7Bp7D554AaABAg.8v3JfXzNde68vj-WUVYsbW
It's moderately ridiculous that virtually everything we do in space is some form of tech that originated 50 years ago. Did we somehow become completely space-stupid since then and forget how to innovate? Almost every other technology has advanced in massive ways, bu then we talk space and suddenly we're trying to take something from the 60's and see if it'll work....it's very odd.	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2019-05-18T03:45:56Z	UC0XRL6YS-DiJwQGQ5EOTThw	none		Ugyl2oo07UaWzLxy_Nh4AaABAg

"Another thing to consider is the fuel mass fraction. Generally the higher the exhaust velocity (and VASIMR has very high exhaust velocity), the less propellant you need to attain high speed. 

Some rough calculations I made using Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation shows that to launch a craft to Mars from Earth orbit along the Hohmann trajectory, using chemical rockets, would need 80% to 90% of the total mass as fuel. Fine if you're launching a small probe, but group of 100 colonists with life support and necessary colonizing equipment?

With VASIMR it drops to just about 4%. It'll take its own sweet time running up to the correct velocity, but it'll get there. Ion engines will open up the Solar System."	uqX8wIkjoYg	3	2019-04-23T04:02:07Z	UCPczSo118ztbNeiUcfnQZ7A	none		UgzWYEQBRqC-LZtWSmV4AaABAg

I'm not too sure about plasma, but the inefficiency of chemical engines primarily come from the behavior of gas in a vacuum. Ideally, you want the same pressure in the nozzle as in the surrounding air, but in a vacuum the surrounding pressure is basically 0. So there is always energy left in the internal state of the gas plume that is not utilized. Its not really a matter of the weight of fuel you bring, because the force is just based on the mass of fuel getting shot out in the other direction. So I'm assuming that plasma reduces the pressure problem that conventional engines have without sacrificing thrust output like ion engines do.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2019-04-04T22:40:19Z	UC1I28o99Rr5Ax-kuO9adFsg	none		UgwuQvrOelnSHWcz3O54AaABAg
rpbajb That’s probably it tbh. Still, it seems like it would only be marginally better than chemical engines. Because while the high thrust is a good selling point for making use of the oberth effect relative to the sun, you can’t accelerate humans at high g levels for long periods of time without them blacking out, so idk if you can make use of that thrust in the first place.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2019-06-06T14:44:16Z	UC1I28o99Rr5Ax-kuO9adFsg	none	UgwuQvrOelnSHWcz3O54AaABAg	UgwuQvrOelnSHWcz3O54AaABAg.8tJxQo4fvoJ8vqK1EMO_Ow

Honestly, I'm always surprised when I hear about this or that propulsion system for a spaceship.  The thing that surprises me?  That it's only ever ONE type of system - that's it.  There's never any discussion about what seems obvious (to me, at least): that it would be better to have a ship that can be propelled in more than one way, with the potential to use various fuels.  It strikes me as odd that no one ever talks about using a mixture of chemical, electric, photonic, etc.  This would seem better, as you could power a ship up to a certain speed using one method, then switch over to something else to conserve fuels.  Why is this such a blank space in propulsion theory?  I'd really like to know.  Seems like you'd want to have several possibilities - the better to make it there & back!!!       tavi.	uqX8wIkjoYg	3	2019-02-24T00:21:50Z	UCyH5dtaM-OPXcWVZSzW0yNg	none		Ugy8vXdghM3DJKf6K7l4AaABAg
"It's already kinda present in a lot of spacecrafts because they often have rcs in addition to another (main) engine.
But your idea isn't that great, at least for now.
Think of it like an hybrid car. Hybrid cars are a lot heavier than ""petrol only"" cars. But not necessarly lighter than electric cars. They aren't as snappy as electric cars nor as efficient. They don't have the range of ""petrol only"" cars because they are too unefficient due to their weight. And they aren't really cheaper than an electric car.
If you get two types of propulsion, you add the downsides but not always the benefits. Plus it's almost always more complicated (so more prone to failure), more expensive, and heavier."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2020-06-10T17:56:21Z	UCyhQ-9pgVcY9oGVrLYGKAcA	none	Ugy8vXdghM3DJKf6K7l4AaABAg	Ugy8vXdghM3DJKf6K7l4AaABAg.8ri8FN2dFH-99jO7tAnMrF

"Project Orion is the best opition.
The Project Orion Vehicle was designed along with the math and science, by some of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th Century most of who got their start in America's nuclear weapons program.
The built working concept models that used conventional explosives and test flew a Orion concept model from the ground and also test flew a concept model in space ; the system works and its simple.
The Project Orion Vehicle was to be powered by Atomic Bombs that  were especially designed for the vehicle, they were of a specific yield, and was a shaped charge, the bomb casing was and is classified but was to be a light weight case and a light weight bomb but gave a yield beyound its expected capabilities , and from reports the results were achieved.
The propulsion system the best eay to describe it is like a firearms revolver that has a cylinder and there are chamber and each chamber holds x number of propellant atom bombs.

The gun obviously faces to the rear of the orion vehicle, surrounding the gun barrel/lunch tube are four huge shock absorbers they are attached to a pusher/ recoil plate.
When the atomic revolver is fired a atom bomb propellant charge is shot down the barrel and propelled 
To a certain distance from the Project Orion Space Vechile and detonated . The shock wave of the bomb ; blast pushes against the pusher/recoil plate propelling the Project Orion Vehicle through space. These bombs would have been shot out the barrel and detonated in spaced rapid succession, they team working on project Orion estimated they could achieve three quarters light speed.
A trip to Mars on the 1950's/1960's technology would have taken three months on way .

All the data for the program still exsists and with modern computers and Science and engineering, we could improve upon this program.
We could cut travel time down to a month or two one way .
That could mean the round trip travel time could be two to four months.
I would also adovcate the building of Sea Dragon to lift the project Orion vehicle into orbit."	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2019-02-21T17:00:30Z	UCKv0a6HJTljPR5ygIQavZaw	none		UgxHqPQVgk7rlCWSS9d4AaABAg

Ion engines would take forever to get up to speed. That’s why we don’t use them. They don’t displace enough mass to move things. The problem with massive speeds is not only the acceleration up to cruising speed, but also getting back down to landing speeds. They’d need to generate enough power to boost the ship up to over 50,000 mph but also slow back down from that speed gradually so the crew doesn’t become a puddle of juice. Then to get home, they’d have to do it again. That’s 4 engine burns to +50k or -50k mph. With the weight of crew and supplies you’re talking energy on the scale of cities not ships.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2019-02-05T20:43:42Z	UC39zIffRzupQfJjz0uxmv_Q	none		Ugzu4mas-9UEiS_rhL94AaABAg

"No no no that's not how it works. You can't just ""go to Mars in 40 days"" like it was a space Concorde. The reason you can get from a place to another in Earth in less time is because distance doesn't change between them and you can use brakes to slow down once you arrive at your destination. But space is another different world. If you go directly straight to Mars you will completely miss it because it is moving in it's own orbit. The reason it takes 6 or 7 months to get to Mars is because you need to get enough speed so your final orbit is high enough that it intersects Mars and its orbit at that particular point. If you wanted to achieve that in 40 days you would need a ridiculously large amount of fuel (so large it would probably have its own gravity lol).


The most important thing when you are in space is efficiency, which even the name states, Specific Impulse. If you can get to another planet with less fuel that means you can have a larger payload and thus it would reduce the cost per kilogram significantly. Once you are in a desired orbit, you must not change your speed or you may never get to the body. 


So, even if you have the most powerful engine imaginable, orbits won't care. Once you are in an established trajectory, that powerful engine will become useless.


It's a great thing that engines like the VASIMR are being developed but it's not so great to promise dreams that are impossible to do.


TL;DR
No, you won't get to Mars in 40 days ever in your life."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2019-02-04T05:19:41Z	UCUGX5F7dEU-uIt8vH8sczIg	none		UgwZcQIvPj5TTNDTVC54AaABAg

I know this is old, and it is semi-interesting, but to travel to Mars in 40 days, the speeds achieved would probably require the entire last half of the flight to be nothing but slowing down again.

it does sound crazy but i think it would only be something like 18 meters per second of acceleration per hour which seems a lot more feasible (earth's gravity being like 540 meters per second per hour of acceleration), also given a nuclear reactor, it seems like they could run the engine nonstop.  idk 1 million miles an hour sounds like a lot but on the grand scheme of things, if you can run an  engine for a while without any resistance (like air resistance or friction) you could get anything to some insane speeds. also like 20 days of just firing an engine is a lot of time so that too, most chemical spacecraft burns only last minutes	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2019-01-21T19:47:37Z	UCxpjBZccUe8hLYO5U5MQTQw	none	UgwqfwV-iVqiLdNROVV4AaABAg	UgwqfwV-iVqiLdNROVV4AaABAg.8q7yedqslUQ8qNfd4X1m_R

We can make an engine that burns as hot as the sun, contain that heat and use the energy but we can’t make an engine for a car that doesn’t run on gasoline, or solve the energy crisis here on earth, cure cancer, explore the oceans which is 70% the surface of the earth. For that matter we can’t even take a real picture of the earth. I call BS. I bought into this science fiction before but no more. if we where able to contain that kind of heat imagine what that tech could be used for it would literally change the world.  If we could come close to that kind of shielding we would have heat resistant materials that already that could prevent fires, our fire dept would have fire proof/ heat proof clothing, mountain climbers would have clothing that would protect them 100% from cold and heat. We don’t see that. That would be commercially worth billions of dollars. But no one has it. Money always wins and if their are no products it doesn’t exist. But yet he says it’s been around since the 70’s. Once again if they aren’t making money with it they won’t continue the work. NASA is a bunch of liars, this is not possible. They have this knowledge but lost the ability to go to the moon yay right. Wake up!

"I am sharing ignorance


I finally see that as usual there is a definition of something or a term, that is being misused creating a flaw in understanding the workings of certain things. It is the definition of power. There truly should not be a misunderstanding of a lot of things with all of these concepts. The fact is, if someone was building an electric powered engine, one that runs off of electricity, what else? They would take into account that they are using conductive, resistive, inductive and capacitive materials or components to make the system work. When you study rocket science, you need to take it further, and take into account eV (Electron volts). Your Electric Propulsion systems will keep failing until you realize that. Yeah, they are failing, and the Wizard of OZ can't fool me. As they mention, ""If you replace your household power supply, with something else, you need to take into account, all of your appliances' power usage."". So lame, and pleasing to my ears. It's so weird how taking those things into account, truly does not register to a lot of people's minds when they hear ""Electric Propulsion"". When I heard power usage in the systems of Electric Propulsion, what do you suppose came to my mind? I was thinking they were thinking the same thing I was thinking. I was thinking that there is no way in this universe, that they were not thinking what I was thinking. That was highly impossible, since technologically, the Earth is where I was in the 1990s; P.S., nah. It is not there yet, it simply just came out of its shell, and it seems that thing won't happen. Remember when you needed Einstein during WWII? You still need one of those. Imagine my surprise that no one could possibly understand what I was thinking. They can understand the Stars in the universe. They can understand that we live on lucky planet Earth. Hey, 'made by God'. Yeah, keep dreaming. And that's just it. It does not matter how it was all made when it comes to science. The thing is, it's there. Hey, you developed the concepts behind a lot of ideas. Oh sorry, I mean ""James Watt""; I mean these people; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) . Not you. Do you also force the concepts behind designs to make them work how you imagine they work? And at some times ignore that you are forgetting something? I will simply keep thinking that nothing is wrong with not knowing something. I will also keep thinking that something is good about knowing something, even if you have to make other people not know about those things. Of course, that is not what's happening here.

"""All we need to do is the power source"" As in 200 MW of power.

Nuclear power is safe and well tested for space applications, at least for low power applications. 

Regardless of power source however, we will need an insane efficiency to be able to cool off the excessive heat as getting rid of waste heat in space is extremely hard. Currently i do not believe we can convert heat from nuclear decay into radio waves efficiently enough.

The main problem with all rockets are the relationships between thrust, reaction mass, ejection speed and power. Thrust is proportional to ejection speed and ejection mass. If we double the ejection speed we get double the delta v (thrust) with the same reaction mass. However, the power output increases with the square of the ejection speed, so we use four times the energy.

Using high thrust with high ejection speeds (photon drives have the largest possible ejection speed) requires extreme amounts of energy. However, we will use much less propellant.

Which makes this not so much a desktop product as a pipe dream so far."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-10-31T23:50:12Z	UCzca4q2Aj-aqdE1mLEkhprQ	none		UgzKA7fvysEkKLDgQHh4AaABAg
"It is also very hard to find any solid information, except that NASA decided against to test the technology to stabilize the orbit of ISS, and that the Canadian space agency awarded the company $1.5 million early 2018.

Of the promised tests and platforms, there are very little evidence.

I would not go as far as some critic who claim it is a hoax, but in my mind there are too many areas beside the propulsion technology that need improvement (some of which are near impossible with our current understanding of natural laws) for this talk about manned missions to Mars be anything but attention seeking propaganda. There are just too many hurdles and the few million dollars are not enough to create the new reactor technology required.

'small nuclear reactors have the potential of being really dangerous..'    You completely make up information and are misleading viewers. Is it more dangerous than riding 10,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen into space? Or having oxygen canisters outside your craft blowing it up? Or a faulty pressure valve causing rapid decompression? (russia - the only deaths in space), or solar panels not deploying ect ect... The only reactors that could be used are the same that are on every satellite, mars rover, and voyager spacecraft (still working since the 70's). No system is perfect and there's always a possibility for fault but the nuclear reactors on all these craft have been one of the most reliably engineered parts. How much more 'extra confident' can you get? Did someone at NASA tell you they didn't want to use reactors? Because they dont seem to have a problem using them on almost everything.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-10-11T06:40:41Z	UCO-b4aMKacleyAZ-froieVA	none		UgzFBIm6lCjuWtl6vyV4AaABAg

Thing is... If a rocket uses this tech traveling 10x 100x the current speed we can now.

No, there isn't any engine that we can build that can destroy Earth.  You speak of a nuclear engine, that is a broad term, do you mean NERVA type nuclear thermal rocket?  That might cause a LOCAL radiation hazard if it crashed.  NERVA has a much lower specific impulse than VASIMR.  This means that if VASIMR takes 40 days to reach Mars with constant thrusting, NERVA can't improve on that.

If you like to send humans you care for out into space you should go with something like a nuclear powered VASMIR or even NERVA. Sending them in a slow under-powered spacecraft that is little more than a gloryfied capsule is not the human-friendly thing to do. Let's be honest: The reason why there is no substantial progress in manned space exploration is a lack of energy in every department. Just like on earth solar does not cut it. Once you have a potent nuclear energy source many possibilities open up but till then it is not very responsible to send people beyond the Moon. Even unmanned spacecraft would benefit a lot from nuclear power that would save it from the embarrassment of doing a brilliant mission landing on a distant, fast moving object only to then starve to dead because the solar panel is obstructed. Or if you have to think about wether you have enough power for that drill, fear the cold night freezing your craft to death while it has to sit idle.

Nice comment! However, remember many CRTs had an ion trap magnet to prevent ions from exiting toward the screen with electrons. It was a small magnet (probably alnico) attached to the CRT neck with a coiled spring or spring metal clip around the neck.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-11-12T12:32:54Z	UCeeXBiNl_3HEGnjkNOknrmg	none	UgwR15jIkdFN5gjJvlB4AaABAg	UgwR15jIkdFN5gjJvlB4AaABAg.8kR8xuD1-nN8nYeEu8rx-p

AdAstra (The VASIMR engine people) have had a 100KW engine ready for the ISS for the last decade, and it has not been delivered yet, nor have they made any developmental announcements. Their proposal for the Mars mission, required a 200,000,000 Watt Nuclear reactor to provide the necessary power. Also, their use of Krypton gas, a rare (1 ppm) and non-renewable component of our atmosphere, would be lost to the space environment. They selected it, as it has a high atomic weight compared to other gases.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-07-28T21:07:17Z	UCqD3MgZBHK3hpy9W-FN-VrQ	none		UgycIgAQPyqaUgdNP914AaABAg

"One thing: 40 days would require the ship to accelerate at close to one gee for one-half the way there, then slow down the other half.  One gee is a firm push.
For every ton [1000 kilograms] of ships mass we would need around 98,000 newtons.
Since the 'push' is continuous, we need newton/meters/seconds...
So about 98 Kilowatts per ton, assuming 100% efficiency from your engine.
Come on, we all know the real numbers are closer to 3-8% efficiency, so let's go with 5%.
Almost two megawatts per ton of ships mass.
How much power does your reactor make?  More important, how much does your reactor+shielding+cooling+radiators+control+containment weigh?
Smallest viable craft for this mission would be on the order of 5+ tons; you got a 5+ megawatt generator that doesn't out-weight the craft?

"Without ""warp drives""  you always have to use reaction types of thrust. Efficiency is the key. less propellant weight and more  sustained thrust and if you want to go to mars , you need to provide a long strong burn and then again when you get there to slow down if you want to get there fast. This  idea is about as far as we can go within physics and materials and i dont see how they can provide the power required without a nuclear reactor now but i sure very high temps and even new changes will come to these designs & could step up the power without adding weight. I guessing the first made will be tested on unmanned probes to test the long term reliability in deep cold space before it be used for human cargo in scaled up versions. Ion rockets produce high velocity, low thrust so for now they not suitable for heavy cargo's but efficient through use of solar panels. Its possible by the time all the political arguing/cost/ vision is worked out , these rockets will be ready anyway so only cosmic radiation (tricky) and zero gravity effects  will be the issues left.

The VASIMR engine that you talk about, needs 200 Mega Watts of power to achieve the 40 day transit, and it was to use Krypton for the propellant, not Argon. Sadly, they are FAR behind their own plans, as a 100 KW test engine was to be placed on the International Space Station about 10 years ago! A thermal-nuclear engine was ready to be used in 1972, tested and approved. It used hydrogen as the propellant, and on a test, fired continuously for more than 2 hours, and had to stop because they ran out of Hydrogen. Better than the Falcon Heavy firing of 3 Minutes.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-06-15T21:55:23Z	UCqD3MgZBHK3hpy9W-FN-VrQ	none		UgzJWqZWsXibM_GZD2d4AaABAg

@Rob J Rick Jasper; it refers to it's ability to vary the specific impulse of the rocket engine. This really means the ability to vary it's exhaust velocity. It can lower it's exhaust velocity while dramatically increasing mass flow to increase thrust. This means it can trade off efficiency for thrust, which is very very important for manned missions limited by time.	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2019-10-20T21:08:13Z	UCxjvGLE0cZNxHGLKBdeS1zA	none	Ugxt9t9pzM1tbnq37P54AaABAg	Ugxt9t9pzM1tbnq37P54AaABAg.8hLOglgl7rx90KC4Ry607k

"(Mercury fuel)+ sodium reactor  designed(NERVA)preheater +(vasimr) exhaust system. = fast.

Thorium reactor preheating mercury to 67°C while also powering the vasimr system.  Preheated fuel gets 2 more thermal increases and then is expelled at ludicrous speeds. 

I think any plasma engines based on an atomicly heavy fuel will be to the crafts benefit.

That's a lot of heat. Can they make a nozzle that will hold up to the heat? Anything near the exhaust ill likely be incinerated.  So  they've fired one of these things for ten ohurs. Well they need ot test it over several months or years to see if it will hold up. Remeber the heat tiles on the shuttle? They had alimited life span and now we're talking about a millions degrees of heat! It would be good if this can work reliably and not blow up on the space craft.	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2018-05-26T09:18:14Z	UCVqmyua3a-bIW-wyKYF81xA	none		Ugy6iZN_qZm0g211Q8V4AaABAg

All you need now is the ship say 110 ton , 1760 M3 of living space for the astronauts cost 800.000.000 dollar . Total cost for mission to Mars ( including the photonic drive ) is 6.8 billion dollar .

"There were theoretical studies on RF heated plasmas done at NASA in the 1970's. I worked in a plasma research lab in the 1990's; we looked at both pulsed and ""continuous"" plasma jets. At one point, we had a 5 KW RF heated plasma system set up to generate plasma from a Helium gas feed (we used Helium to avoid any explosion hazard from gas leaks). Our group published a number of papers over about 8 years, and there were several other research groups in Canada and the U.S. doing studies on various aspects of plasma jets. So, the idea already had quite a bit of engineering groundwork study. Now, if we really want to move a whole bunch of mass to Mars in a relatively short period, we might want to consider the Orion concept, developed in the late 1950's-early 1960's by Theodore Taylor and a research group that included Freeman Dyson. There are those who say the idea is crazy, but that, like many ideas, is subject to review if our needs change."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-05-13T05:43:55Z	UCkxItY3JfotxSi8moUT8Qfw	none		Ugzper8mcfMxPS6ibGx4AaABAg

In the 1960's, mankind went to the moon, we planted a flag, looked around a bit and came home. It was described as a dog running up a hill, sniffing around a bit and then peeing to mark its territory. A mission to Mars will be exactly like that and serves very little purpose to help the 9 billion of us here on earth. I know that some of you will come up with the lame argument that the moonshot gave us a lot of technology but we could have created that same technology with mission right here on earth that we have barely gotten to know yet.

We actually have the technology to build a small nuclear power plant that could provide the energy necessary for the VASIMR engine by utilizing and completing the development for the thorium molten salt nuclear reactor. We know that thorium molten salt nuclear reactors can work because we had one working at the Oak Ridge government research center in Tennessee up until Pres. Nixon discontinued the research in favor of enriched uranium nuclear power plants which are much more susceptible to having a nuclear accident. Enriched uranium nuclear power plants are also breeder nuclear plants that allow uranium to turn into plutonium so that it’s possible to make nuclear bombs. It’s much more difficult and expensive to use thorium to make nuclear bombs.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-03-14T09:34:21Z	UCuDmn07MwmqTjJuBB_xppMg	none		Ugzn7yrDOKvq6YtpWQV4AaABAg

I know this’ll sound like total B.S, but it’d be easier to use the feasible space elevator I designed with today’s technology, to get supplies up to space to construct a spacecraft that uses the hybrid thrusters I designed with today’s technology, and we could use nuclear reactors that cut weight by using the gamma ray shield I designed with today’s technology for power. It’d also help to contract space-time by making a sort of black dwarf with the cold plasma I designed with today’s technology. The only thing I haven’t thought much about or done much research for, is fusion reactors rather than fission reactors. Still, free energy is the nut I’ve come close to cracking with a few different iterations.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-02-22T21:13:24Z	UC6sAs614mLnTmRIDOttItMw	none		Ugwh4-89oQH8UqHRNlh4AaABAg

"Consider the fission pumped laser.

Construct a large cavity filled with uranium 235 hexafluoride, xenon hexafluoride, and helium.

Surround with a set of louvers of neutron reflecting material that can be opened and closed like a Venetian blind. Set the louvers so that a fission chain reaction begins and control it to keep the reaction at a desired level. 

As fission occurs, U-235 breaks up into high energy pairs of lighter nuclei, which ionize the helium. Ionized helium activates xenon hexafluoride causing a population inversion. If mirrors are properly placed, a fission pumped xenon hexafluoride laser will come into operation.

The power in such a beam would be circa 10% of all of the fission energy released, so output power on the order of tens of megawatts would be generated. Send this out through a window into a nozzle into which hydrogen gas is pumped. The hydrogen would be heated up to temperatures on the order of tens of thousands of degrees K. This hydrogen forms the exhaust jet that propels the rocket.

No steam or other vapor engine is needed to spin a shaft. No electric generator is needed. No conversion of electric power into thrust is needed. The U-235 XeF6 & He mixture needs to be cooled to maintain the population inversion or the mixture reaches thermal equilibrium at which point lasing stops. 

This is an alternative way of producing thrust that has never been properly investigated."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-02-12T02:46:25Z	UCiLaOz5Dls6QXVWGcNN59NQ	none		UgwwNgl2gDhjcRjmmFF4AaABAg

"""When the first human sets foot on Mars, we'll probably have made it there with a chemical engine."" -- No, chemical rockets can give us the initial speed to escape Earth's gravity and coast to Mars, but that's all they can do, they are so inefficient, they can only carry enough fuel for minor course corrections & Mars orbit insertion after the main burn to leave Earth orbit.  That 3 months coasting journey just TO Mars, means 3 months of weightlessness which is very bad for human muscle tone and bone integrity.  Only new technology which can provide continuous 1G acceleration for most of the to and from journeys will make a trip to Mars safe for humans.  Looks like the VASIMR engine might do that.

You need fusion.  It will be the last piece of the puzzle. Once we have that the solar system is ours. There is one bonus to an impulse drive.  Gravity!! You basically accelerate your craft creating artificial gravity then halfway there you have a big zero g party as you spin the ship around and start to decelerate which also creates gravity.. NASA has spent all these years studying the effects of zero g on humans when there was little point. To get to Mars or anywhere really you are going to end up with artificial gravity whether you like it or not.  The ships just coasting along with spinning sections just won't really happen.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-02-04T23:35:13Z	UC40NOecpFAIqT-u5B7eIHfw	none		UgyUmrVoRZ1-hDqE7y14AaABAg

If people accidentally inhale this, the α-particles would most definitely harm them if not kill them.

"This engine is a wonderful example of how the concept of ""efficiency"" changes with the application.  Frequently as the scale or use changes, different factors become the true limiting factor.  Chemical engines are inefficient with their use of reaction mass but surprisingly efficient with energy.  Ion engines are efficient with reaction mass but absolutely horrible in terms of energy efficiency.  The difference is the application and what you have to work with.  If you have plenty of time and plenty of energy, ion propulsion's particular type of efficiency becomes more practical.  If you have little time and can afford the mass, a chemical rocket's specific types of efficiency becomes more practical.

Obviously, this generally gets lumped in as practicality, but it's important to think about it in those terms sometimes or you might blind yourself to unworkable negatives while chasing an unnecessary level of one specific aspect of efficiency."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-01-21T08:34:17Z	UC01yPPsUkQhE1EqWfNf5FYg	none		UgxqxGYvJOF55DTf_0N4AaABAg

VASIMR, if it were practical, would save time and fuel, not waste it.

As Professor Erik Verlinde pointed out, there is subtle similarity between gravitation field and temperature gradient of attraction in the context of entropy. Therefore, the opposite can be true.  Antigravitation field if exists can be mysteriously similar to temperature gradient of repulsion when ridiculously hot gas is spontaneously released into extreme cold temperature gradient.  There is work when temperature change is as large as possible.  As million degrees centigrade plasma such as those inside a fusion reactor suddenly hitting a cold temperature gradient will provide undeniably large work propelling mass forward.  If and only if a million centigrade plasma hits near absolute zero temperature gradient such as space or cavity of near absolute zero inert gas, the work will be impressive.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-01-02T05:12:41Z	UCfnRqZ2jVyYs2GywWwRG6hg	none		UgxPDVBRihU7B8kBuDZ4AaABAg

That is not even the biggest problem. A 200 Megawatt nuclear reactor would produce around 600 MW of waste heat. Heat that you cannot simply dump into the next river. That means you need radiators. The heat radiators on the ISS for example are able to radiate 70 KW of excess heat away from the space station. Considering that they weigh nearly 10 tons, that means that a similar system for such a spaceship would weigh around 80,000 Tons. You could most definitely improve on that by raising the operating temperature, but that goes only so far before you loose reactor performance. So maybe with clever heat management and more modern materials, you could bring it down to 8,000 Tons, but even that is a ridiculous amount of weight for a ship that only produces 5000 Newtons of thrust(which is not even a third of the thrust from the Apollo Lunar Ascent stage).	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2018-01-07T23:48:19Z	UCsHILTB4HOM9RliyLFKvo2w	none	UgytHYyVw6uO4T9j8Jl4AaABAg	UgytHYyVw6uO4T9j8Jl4AaABAg.8aoBgqzBm6j8b8CuLDC8NT

"I don't get it. To go to Mars in 40 days we would roughly accelerate 20 days and decelerate for 20 days in order to reach orbital velocity or whatever. 
Ofc it is not so, Hoffman transfer tells Mars is traveling faster than the spacecraft, and we should accelerate some more to match the speed and start descent (standard rocket technology), or any gravitational combination of trip length vs velocity (new technology). But nevertheless we need lots of movement quantity to achieve the acceleration needed, some more to decel."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-12-29T13:00:55Z	UCEtJVC_NElNj5b4Mz67an1A	none		UgzNHso1HGxYw__-ypx4AaABAg

Yes, that's the idea.

Your paragraph about Hohmann transfer trajectory is not coherent.  I can't tell what you are trying to say.  The Hohmann trajectory is a minimum energy trajectory for getting from one planetary orbit to another with the minimum delta-V.  A craft designed to accelerate halfway, then decelerate halfway at fairly high acceleration, would not take a path resembling a Hohmann trajectory, starting when the start and destination planet were on nearly opposite sides of their orbits.  That sort of craft makes the fastest trip and uses the least fuel/delta-V by taking the trip when the planets are near their closest approach."	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2019-01-09T07:44:16Z	UCBgPqtLJ4xHjdmx4PHTFeHw	none	UgzNHso1HGxYw__-ypx4AaABAg	UgzNHso1HGxYw__-ypx4AaABAg.8akseox4feA8psUJaw7sts

There's still questions about how would a nuclear reactor would work in space. Because in space, there's so much more radiation from the sun and also just from the universe. Then there's the question of material. What type of low weight material can handle such high temperatures, mechanical stress, and vibration for long periods of time? The last question is cost. Aluminum is light weight and less dense, but you would take up a lot of volume in order to try to compete with strength of steel. Titanium is an option.

"Ok I was really close to a thumbs down here.
Awesome topic and motivation, but the whole explanation is just fancy sounding buzzwords!
From your 5 minute video, I cannot understand much beyond ""it creates a plasma with microwaves as propellant"".
So many questions go unanswered! Why is this better? Ok, I can guess - higher nozzle speeds. So what kind of nozzle speeds are we talking about? Some data please? A comparison to chemical engines?
Then you blend in some schematics, but instead of explaining them you just blend in your big flashy buzzwords! Do you want to teach something or just get a ""sounds cool"" from your audience?
In the end, you measure and compare the development of the engine in kW -  which does not even say anything at all about the engines effectiveness at unknown nozzle velocity. After all, its the thrust that is interesting.
Overall, I love that you are making such videos but you should not ""simplify"" your content to the degree of meaninglesnes.

"Problem  with this kind of engine .
It's great as long you don't have to land and launch again.

""they aren't strong enought to launch spacecraft into space"", well once you're on mars, how you go back then?

I know what you're gonna said : ""then couple it with few chemical engine for takeoff and landing""
well but that's at the cost of making it heavier and more complex , so less effective ,  more expensive and more prone to failure.

Well the takeoff can resolved if you bring with the flight or with an other flight, or manufacture on place, a booster that will do the same job than on earth. will still be at the cost of effectivness if you don't manufacture it on place tho.
you'll still have to deal with the landing...."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-12-03T10:41:54Z	UCi993iYk5tZ3r_tfLlC5Bwg	none		UgwykvvOG7EZ0NWpmVN4AaABAg
"I think you've got it slightly wrong. You'd use this sort of engine on a permanent orbiter. 

The thrust to fuel usage ratio of the engine type is ideal for economical resupplies and long-term exploration, and these sorts of spacecraft would be immensely expensive to build. You wouldn't want this thing going anywhere close to sub-orbital once you have it built. This would end up being something akin to what military seaborne ships currently are: a vehicle that gets constantly upgraded and retrofitted with new technology while remaining in service.

For landing, you attach smaller, expendable, two-stage landing craft (similar to the lunar lander, but with bigger engines) to it and the ship stays in space permanently, coming to and from earth/other planets to resupply or do awesome science stuff as missions dictate."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-12-04T22:59:03Z	UCDQGFwNZnIrGsU0gntRuyMQ	none	UgwykvvOG7EZ0NWpmVN4AaABAg	UgwykvvOG7EZ0NWpmVN4AaABAg.8_hg4mcj4PK8_l_ElQtFS5
"Perhaps using a three or six chamber magnetic system. Introduce hydrogen as a primary using fusion/ion to convert to helium, eject helium for propulsion. Manifold more hydrogen/helium from space diverted into the extra chambers. Use secondary cosmic rays to keep the system running. Now that I think about it an uneven chamber system would probably work better, unless you wanted to keep a fusion reactor running all the time. Not like we would be leaving into interstellar space. A small ionization system would be sufficient.

the problem is that VASIMR is not designed to be a powerful thruster, its designed to bridge the gap between high SI/low thrust and low SI/high thrust. since the power requirement is the same you could use the same engine to give a steady and fuel efficient thrust for a long time, or a powerful thrust that will consume the fuel faster. the problem with nuclear power is the heat, the amount of energy you can generate is equal to the difference of temperature reached by the fluid used, and its VERY hard to dissipate heat in space, in the end the amount of weight you waste with radiators don't compensate the extra thrust. so the other option is just to use the heat of the reactor directly to power a Nuclear thermal rocket.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-12-02T06:56:02Z	UCg_MRqpOZ9eXMOnonQQRkIw	none		UgyYsbpTEepgf1c5oDp4AaABAg

"The propulsion for these future rockets are the same for stars and black holes in the zero gravity of space, energy, electricity, ions, and even light. Hmm maybe they should rethink the movement of stars and galaxies containing a black hole in their core? they have pinned this propulsion on elusive dark matter and dark energy. I discovered a 1:10,000 ratio between a star's velocity and age. Which would mean that stars propel themselves by ion propulsion over time, not because of missing mass and gravity, i.e., dark matter. If true then Einstein's field equations will only work on small objects like planets, asteroids, comets and dust clouds, etc., objects smaller than stars. His field equations will not work on stars and black holes older than 10,000 years old. This was why dark matter had to be added to his equations, fill in the gaps to explain the velocity of stars and galaxies. His field equations are wrong because he neglected to address the action responsible for gravity. He ended his field equations with T, which stands for surface tension but failed to finish. Because with surface tension comes pressure, and the laws of thermodynamics states that with pressure heat is produced. Producing heat is not a conversion of mass into energy but adds energy to a so called closed system. This is the missing variable that explains the expansion of space, i.e., dark energy.

There, I just solved the dark matter and dark energy mysteries in one paragraph. You're welcome."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T21:10:04Z	UC869ggkg-pTbPPSBIvMOt4Q	none		UgzzYuI4x4v49h8j0994AaABAg
I love the fact that everyone thinks the greatest obstacle to get to Mars is speed. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and there is no place this is more relevant than space. Whatever energy you put into acceleration you will need to put into deceleration. If you fail to decelerate you will overshoot your target/destination. Of course you have to minus the energy required to escape earths gravity and orbit but still its challenging. Thats one of the reasons it takes so long with todays technology because a reserve of breaking fuel must be carried unless you travel at the same speed that allows safe entry. With todays technology that requires either fuel or stored energy that must make up part of the payload. Fusion offers the only hope for long distance space travel but we are a long way off. Another option could be altering space time through the creation of large gravity fields such as a warp drive but this is even further away from our current technology and could be likened to controlling a small black hole or neutron star that travels in front of the craft pulling it along but I predict would most likely pull the craft apart instead, the theory put forward is to have the entire craft in a bubble that is somehow unaffected by this force but have the force effect the bubble as a whole. Absolutely possible in theory but energy requirements are at levels of inconceivable amounts and creating the bubble is also beyond science fiction at this stage and most likely impossible to achieve and control with our knowledge and understanding. To decelerate would also require the system to be able to turn on and off this black hole or neutron star like device, place it in any direction around the crafts bubble and somehow control its 'polarity?' To create acceleration. Such a system would not fare well if mechanical failure were to happen and it is hard to believe that any 'mechanical' device as we know it could generate or control such a system. Back to fusion, possibly the best option and even the warp drive would require some form of fusion to create its driving force. Hmmm its seams we will be launching apes with firecrackers to nearby rocks for some time to come!	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T20:36:45Z	UCvizHwpKVbM1v9wuytdvYQg	none		UgyG-HH14sFR3PgwcUl4AaABAg

"Nucear reactor in space is not a huge problem as it is on earth. There are reactor types that can't have a core melt. And the dangers of explosion is the same or even less than a chemical fuel like hydrazine or just oxygen and hydrogen because what explodes in a reactor is mostly just hydrogen. The biggest problem of nuclear reactors is the radiation and the radiating waste it produces, but since the space is full of radiation anyhow, that's not such of a deal either.

Probably more difficult is to get that reactor into space safely, and it would be propably better just to shoot the parts up seperate and assemble it in orbit so that a failure of the rocket wouldn't turn into a huge ""dirty bomb"".

After some time those reactors could also be created on moon where an explosion does not endager a whole ecosystem."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T19:08:49Z	UCnNuU4tA_piSuUYK7iVUhjA	none		Ugz9-2g7QczjW2kX2_B4AaABAg
Actually it is a bigger problem than on Earth. Here you can just use water to get rid of the excess heat. In Space you have to radiate this heat away. For example the heat radiators for the ISS weigh roughly ten tons. They are able to radiate 70 KW of thermal energy away from the station. But a thermal nuclear reactor like SAFE-400, which would be able to provide enough power for a 100 KW VASIMR, produces 300 KW of excess heat. That means the radiator would weigh more than 40 tons. And even if you could improve the efficiency by a factor of 10 that would still be 4 tons of radiator + 0.5 tons reactor + 0.5 tons VASIMR, + several tons of propellant. All for a mere 2.5 Newtons of thrust.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T22:37:24Z	UCsHILTB4HOM9RliyLFKvo2w	none	Ugz9-2g7QczjW2kX2_B4AaABAg	Ugz9-2g7QczjW2kX2_B4AaABAg.8_ZHv31QuIG8_ZempTx9_2

"Lazic B. Heat is a problem to consider for spacecraft! To further your main point, power is harvested via heat transferred not just being hot! Lucky there is a way to dump heat in space, thermal radiation. The limiting factor is surface area, easy to maximize. If your using your reactor to make thrust. Then u are also getting ride of heat that way.

    As far as solar goes, the big problem is further away from the sun you are the less power it makes. mars gets allot less light than earth. The moons night is a little less than mouth, are u going to store a months worth of power? In the moons case u can just put heat into the ground. what about missions to Jupiters moons? Pluto? the Oort cloud? Solar power just doesn't works well in more than half of the solar system! Not to mention past that. u want an intergalactic civilization? without Nuclear power its practically impossible.

    To echo Matthew Padilla a bit. They would be containing the heat as mush as plausible.

That is capable to also help with assembling spaceships in space itself. Then you only need a rocket strong enough to lift people and cargo frome earth to the station and back.

"VASIMR is an interesting technology, but it has been completely over-hyped and blown out of proportion. Yes, the specific impulse is better than chemical rockets, but that performance comes at a cost of ridiculous amounts of power. The ""39"" days claim made by Franklin Chang Díaz assumed a nuclear reactor size of 200 megawatts. That is almost the size of an aircraft carrier, and such a short trip would require a powe-to-weight ratio of 1kw/kg; That is a power/weight 100 times whats been demonstrated in space. To go along with that science fiction power source you would also need radiators the size of several football fields (adding even more weight). All of this adds enormous cost and complexity to a Mars a human Mars mission. Is it really worth it to spend decades and billions of dollars trying to get later-life cancer risk of astronauts down by a few percent? Hell, if we wanted to save a few lives we could just have NASA recruit a few smokers for a mission and we'd be lowering their cancer risk by not letting them smoke their tobacco. Mars missions are going to be dangerous and frankly if you are too impatient to to wait a few months and too picky take some risks, then you simply are not cut out for this kind of job."	uqX8wIkjoYg	1	2017-11-29T09:17:45Z	UCmXOIa-ekEqHyoJewsD_PXQ	none		UgycVjsaNzYXq7sIBqt4AaABAg

"200 MW is a lot of power. With Solar power,  assuming multi-junction cells with around 40% efficiency, you'd get an average of 546.8 watts per square meter near Earth and 241.4 watts per square meter around Mars. if you want to send the ship back fast as well,  you'd need at least roughly 0.83 square kilometers of solar panels. Those are some big solar panel arrays for space - if it was a single perfectly square array, it would be around 910 meters by 910 meters in size.  

A nuclear reactor would be a lot more compact, but you'd need some very large radiators and a good cooling/plumbing system to keep it from overheating."	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T07:36:01Z	UCcaKRWGHnqPLdhaRqa7hjGA	none		UgzfHDfZvzv3zACRExR4AaABAg

When you look at the facts, Mars is not habitable and there is more water elsewhere in the solar system. The problems with its gravity, radiation levels and other risks to human health don't really make it an option for permanent colonisation. I used to think it was the master plan but now considering all the facts I think it will be nothing more than a very expensive science experiment. I think that very clever genetic engineering may be necessary to create a subspecies of human that can survive the long term on Mars and advanced robotics will be the key to creating habitats. At this stage of human development and considering the damage we are doing to our own planet I think humanity needs to address the issues facing Earth because getting people to Mars so our species perishes on both planets does little to save humanity. Sometimes we have to pull our head out of the sky and plant our feet back on the ground.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T06:37:48Z	UCvizHwpKVbM1v9wuytdvYQg	none		UgyXxQ1oOdIUp5eM0Y14AaABAg
Icar us you are very correct and rational in your comment. It shows your commitment to reality unlike so many dream like ambitious talk that is often heard. It will be interesting to see if we achieve landing humans on Mars and returning them safely to Earth. There is still the reality of orbit alignment to consider and the challenge of communication when both planets are on opposite sides of the Sun which the latter can be overcome but the length of stay on Mars cannot due to the extreme distance when orbits are at maximum distance. Regardless of what I think the other challenge will be economic and whether or not it fizzles like the Moon landings due to no economic benefit. In order for a colony to be established it will require either an economic benefit to investors on Earth or to be able to set up its own economy on Mars. Very challenging stuff and a problem that is often overlooked. Like I said, feet back on the ground and head out of the skies!.	uqX8wIkjoYg	0	2017-11-29T08:49:12Z	UCvizHwpKVbM1v9wuytdvYQg	none	UgyXxQ1oOdIUp5eM0Y14AaABAg	UgyXxQ1oOdIUp5eM0Y14AaABAg.8_XwyTLWsKz8_YB0-MFpxK

We've already done most of the interesting missions that can be launched on a politically stable timeline (4-8 years before new politicians are voted in that want defund existing projects in order to fund their pet projects?)

I'd love to see ~6 Starships docked into a massive inflatable space station, and launch it to the Mars transit orbit by using the Starships as boosters. We'd deliver a gateway station to the red planet, if that's not the coolest thing I don't know what is! It would also allow more cargo space, more living space for the passengers, and create redundancy by including multiple modules and Starships if something goes wrong etc. Multiple Starships should be enough to haul it to the Mars orbit until some of them will disembark and land. Once it's time to head home, the Starships will dock with the station and haul it back to Earth. #wdtj why aren't we doing this?!	5nE3UO1kqv0	1	2021-03-09T16:06:50Z	UCk0OlDL_IiMTFZ4CSY5-apA	none		UgwcW91L8nV9q7m61KZ4AaABAg

This is really impressive, and I’m really excited to see where it will go, but I guess my main problem with it is that it would be really difficult to incorporate windows into the inflatable design. I guess you could put the windows in capsules attached to the inflatable part, but I feel like that would kind of defeat the purpose, because the windows wouldn’t be in the main section. Who knows, maybe they’ll figure it out.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2021-02-01T03:00:06Z	UCzgW-Gz3I_0otzvee1KLJeQ	none		UgyZH7wVMTQW_NWiMrx4AaABAg

In hindsight, NASA's interest in having BEAM attached to the space station was a way to tie up the program so that Biggilow would 't do anything else with it.

Sixteen people? According to my calculations the BA2100 can barely accommodate ten people when accounting for social distancing. In addition, this can only be accomplished if each Bigenaut is tethered to a fixed and equidistant point located on the interior wall of the space habitat. Now, should they opt for Smallenauts then it may be possible to accommodate eleven space-cationers. A word of caution: crossing the tethers and becoming entangled with each other could result in a Habitat for Insanity.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2020-07-11T22:21:25Z	UC2_CEJmyfwTqi7Rh7PdGwig	none		Ugy-tJchSrIN-Z0l39l4AaABAg

you idiots who think people will live in space are EXTREMELY STUPID.  you idiots can't even live on a world that we are created for.  are you willing to place your life on someone else 24 HOURS A DAY, EVERY DAY , because that is what will happen if people went into space. it will only take ONE person making a error to KILL everyone on a ship. how many people has even LIVED in isolation where everything is limited, like your oxygen, water and food supply, and having real privacy .

"The reason hydrogen is a good shielding material for certain types of radiation could be best illustrated using a pool table, with the balls being analogous to hydrogen nuclei and the radiation particles, particularly  neutrons, while the walls of the pool table are analogous to the heavier atoms of the aluminum skin of the station. When a pool ball (neutron) hits another pool ball (hydrogen nucleus), a large part of the pool ball's (neutron's) energy is passed to the second pool ball (hydrogen nucleus), rendering the neutron less energetic and dangerous.


This, by the way is how neutrons cause biological damage. If the hydrogen nucleus happens to be in a human body, the resulting highly energetic hydrogen nucleus can cause all sorts of ionization damage to things like, for example, DNA - nothing of importance going on there.


Back to our analogy, if the pool ball strikes something much heavier, like the walls of the table (aluminum nucleus), little energy is transferred to the wall (aluminum atom). The pool ball (neutron) just bounces off in a different direction with about the same energy.  This is why heavier shielding materials that shield gammas well (a whole different method of interaction), are more transparent to neutrons.


For gammas and x-rays, denser materials with lots of electrons and big electric fields such as lead are better shields, because gammas and x-rays mainly interact with electrons and electric fields through compton scattering, pair production, and photoelectric effect.


For things like protons and alphas, both charged particles, which interact strongly with the electric fields of nuclei, almost any material is a good shield.


This is why the shielding in nuclear power plants is not just lead.  A combination of materials is used to provide adequate shielding for both the gamma and neutron radiation a reactor produces.


The problem in a spacecraft is that the materials that are ideal for x-ray and gamma shielding are probably too heavy to be practical for much use in space.  There are other things that can be done.  Store your water and other consumables between you and the radiation. If you know the direction the radiation is coming from, such as in a solar event, you can orient the spacecraft to put as much mass (fuel tanks, food, water, consumables) between you and the source as possible. The fuel Space-X is using would be highly effective for shielding neutrons and other particle radiation, though less effective as a gamma/x-ray shield.  Any mass is better than nothing.  Also you might be able to strategically place some lead in the ship in ways that might be effective enough, but not add too much weight. They will need some sort of gamma/x-ray shielding in deep space. They just have to engineer their way into an effective but not too heavy shield.


Once on other planets/moons, things like soil and lava tubes will be used extensively for shielding. While they are not ideal as shields compared with other materials, they have the advantage of already being there, and relatively easy to access and use in quantities and ways that can be effective enough.



When walking around outside of your shielded enclosures either in space or on another planet/moon, there will be no shielding, so time outside will be limited. If we colonize a place like Europa, where we can live in the subsurface ocean habitats, shielding will not be an issue at all, as a few meters of water/ice will shield about all of the radiation. We could live in subsurface habitats on a place like Titan too, with its methane lakes.  A few meters down, we would be totally safe.


The big nut to crack is not the planets and moons where plenty of shielding options exist, but mainly deep space, where we have to carry the bulk and weight of shielding with us."	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2020-02-13T05:53:41Z	UC8tpfK-ucAzipZjqSXr-eQw	none		Ugxrt8NDW9ZAh1z6d7F4AaABAg

Claus Bohm heliocentric rhetoric that has no basis in reality. Gravity is an outdated theory that has never been proven. You cannot have gas pressure without containment. A pressure gradient does not negate nor bypass the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Higher pressure will always equilize by expanding into a lower pressure volume. You believe in things that are demonstrably fallacious and must invoke the existence of an alternate reality to afford your position any credibility.

"you are not a big advocate of going into deep space......you mention that there are real obstacles about going to space such as mars...the distance/time, the radiation, the no G problem....These ""problems"" are really not problems at all.....1) the time to go to mars or to another planet is not a game stopper....we have had people orbiting the earth for up to 400 days which is less time than it takes to get to mars.....actually about 3 months, 90 days..we don't need nuclear rockets to speed up the transit time.....2) radiation...In space there is always the risk of gamma rays, but these can penetrate us on earth....as for other radiation, it has been calculated that going to mars increases your risk of getting cancer by about one percent,...not a big risk at all....and during the trip, if a solar flare erupts, the crew can go to safe quarters protected by water or fuel tanks till the flare passes...3) ""O"" G.....this has been understood to be a problem since Werner Von Braun envisioned his Moon-Space Station-mars project. Von Braun knew as most scientists know that man is created to live in a one G environment....Despite this,.. Nasa refuses to look at artificial G devices and technology, insisting that by using drugs and exercise, man can adapt to ""O"" G.......all of this has been proven to be WRONG....Nasa just won't acknowledge they have been wrong re ""O"" G for the last 50 years.There are simple ways to make artificail gravity including rotating the spacecraft on a tether on the way to mars or other locations ( see "" the case for mars"" by robert zubrin).....We need private enterprise to get us to mars.....Bigelow, Blue Horizon, SpaceX will do it...Nasa is a big failure. You mention the International Space Station...It,.. like the shuttle to no where has been a colossal joke and a huge waste of taxpayer money....Many books written about the shuttle debacle,,,, I suggest you read ""Challenger"" and also read ""Star crossed orbits"" a tell all about the stupid ISS......Free enterprise will get us to Mars......Nasa and our corrupt gov't and the Military Industrial complex companies it supports ( like Boeing.....Google Boeings failure at the 737 MAX aircraft.......covering up deficiencies...just to make money)...won't get us off this planet....."	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-10-14T00:18:25Z	UC6f9T17kDltUqP8c4v_8sPg	none		Ugz7R0LToHj6DR5LYM54AaABAg

"with current tech, it is unlivable long term. What we need is massive 1km wide by 5km or so cylinders rotating to create gravity, and able to angle toward or away from the sun to perfectly regulate incoming light and internal climate. With weapon systems around the hull to vaporise any incoming micrometeor or unplanned space craft on collision course before the humans onboard are even aware of it. 


once we can do that, earth becomes redundant, as the perfect climate of such a habitat would be prefered for living, food production, pretty much everything.

This stronger than Kevlar material sounds promising especially since it dissipates energy of micro meteors. Also polyurethane, water and hydrogen shields well against heavy radiation and Gamma rays. Also I can see where a donut shaped kevlar polyeurothane tube could be inflated and fitted over the long tubular spacecraft like a sheath. Then filled with either water or hydrogen as protection against radiation for use on long missions.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-08-28T01:31:12Z	UCGnieTf2lYczvTRRtSQSYLQ	none		Ugyp5MR45HJuOprvqWF4AaABAg

Magnetic fields? ... Hmmm... Magnets make magnetic fields.... There's actually actual tech that keeps magnetic fields to them selves somewhat... Also magnetic fields cut down radiation a good bit on they're own... Just an idea don't get mad, or a$$ about it... Why not use magnets for a radiation protection, or something... But I got the Information from YouTube on the part about keeping magnetism to it's  selfish... Also the rest of it being magnets create a magnetic field is common info, but there is a catch, and it's magnets have a stronger pulling effect when in space. So you would have to go a little bit higher in orbit, because of magnets being attracted to each other... Yet electric magnets are nutral so it shouldn't have that much of a want to go back to Earth effect...I hope this was something to think about...or do you think I'm a idiot... Also the space industry is missing some more stuff. If you have space builders you need space building tech. To space building tech you need a place to sell it, and/ or build it. To build it you need factories for space building. To feed the factories you need mines, and there's plenty of mining sites on the moon. If you mind out, or in a crater you can turn it in to a colony, or living site. Yet with space mines you need space refineries so you can feed the factories....

A Good idea would be double layered rip stock nylon and to use a foam to fill the air cavity's the foam would stiffen giving strength to the structure, this could be deployed in space, or on a planet like Mars or the moon . The habitat could be pressurized. Even used as a escape pod that could re enter Earth's atmosphere with a parachute it would float. A double wall foam filled capsule could have a quick patch kit to fill holes and patch.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-07-03T20:45:51Z	UCcV3OmZ_yaFzxzs1VHlEA_A	none		Ugwm4pdZXNxyPn00MBR4AaABAg

"Too many comments to search through, but at least one must have been the idea of using some of these modules to build a space wheel to provide various ""gravities"".  Why is there not already a simple ""wheel"" space station to simulate Martian gravity and find out in Earth orbit if people can stay healthy at that gravity level?  Because if not, we can scrap the whole plan for Mars, right?  Then focus might turn to Venus and maybe inflatable cities in the clouds.

That is such good news! I wasn't aware those modules had passed these durability tests. Bigelow could literally be the next big thing in space.

The lunar hab designs are even more practical when you consider that the lunar regolith can be turned into 'mooncrete' with nothing more than microwave heating. The upshot is you can inflate your usable space - cover it with lunar regolith, harden it into a permanent structure - deflate the core and repeat. A massive base can be made quickly and withstand radiation and micrometeorite impacts. All at a far cheaper cost than earth to lunar solutions and far more versatile. As a progression of career paths - why wouldn't a real-estate tycoon with Hotel assets want to develop real-estate and habitats off-world? Seems logical to me.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-04-06T11:10:03Z	UC28bAQAhyprcOBdCZQvi02g	none		UgxQ3Eov4zQdBy8uRzR4AaABAg

"People we live in a world full of technology, so much so that technology is replacing human labor... Some see this as a bad thing. but only due to one reason... Money! 
But our technology has grown to the point that such a tool is no longer needed. We have the ability due to Automation and Autonomous tech to remove that concept and its Limitation.
Also the hardships and corruption that its creates.  We could provide for all the worlds people without cost ,coercion or servitude.  By doing so we can finally solve problem and grow as a society."	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-03-13T18:15:55Z	UCo6Fd5gMSkRf9JGP1p3M3RA	none		Ugx-KLX6Vg_ZRUzqaOB4AaABAg

It's great to see technologies such as these being developed. Bigelow working on habitats, SpaceX working on launch-delivery systems and maybe someone out there is working the next generation of super long-range communication. But, I continue to be dismayed by the all-to-often reference to a 'space-race.' It's 2019 and many of the industrialized countries on this planet, especially the U.S., are still very juvenile in their thinking and approach to solving major problems on this planet. Why does everything have to be a race?! When will leadership stop measuring everything by who has the most X or Y? It's way past time to grow up and fully embrace the idea of 'cooperative' development and engineering. Yes, it's being done at various levels but not enough to really put a dent in the things that require serious and sustained, global teamwork. I think way more resources are wasted by competing with one another than what could be achieved if people worked together on a national scale. Until that happens, we are probably doomed to die on this planet from our own stupidity, ignorance and overblown self-importance.	5nE3UO1kqv0	1	2019-03-06T00:54:04Z	UC2FLfVIFjLo1zN8GkJyoOeg	none		UgzfUdiQAIFLyMU1R2V4AaABAg

Problem is the Bigelow has been 'building' this project for more then a decade, he picked up the right technology and while they have done good demonstration I don't see any truly new tech.  They will likely serve as a contractor for construction of these modules, but I don't see them as an operator of the station.  The stations are completely dependent on launch services to bring customers, it's more likely the launch provider buys the hardware from Bigelow and runs the station, that puts all launch delays and loss of revenue for the station on the launcher.	5nE3UO1kqv0	1	2019-03-05T00:28:49Z	UCxpAoUeR02DnEJrGhB842pA	none		UgytCPGfQTGj-Z94Dxx4AaABAg

Everyone is cheering but no one is taking Bigelow concept seriously, since inflatable structure makes people apprehensive. Technically, it's a ballon and we grew up to know the balloons can blow, unless it's filled with cement. If Bigelow  inflatable walls could be filled with liquid substance, which would later solidify and turn a soft wall in to a thick rigid radiation protective shell, now we are talking.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-03-04T02:04:29Z	UC-h5UqnDzW8351CrBQ6Vc8A	none		Ugxh-RG0lUJUwcGlzhB4AaABAg
"I meant pup the walls of Bigelow module with solidifying material with radiation protective properties. It will prevent module catastrophic  collapsing or (blown up). In addition, if  ""pumped"" substance can have self-healing ability, it will improve safety issue.

I'm sure there are thousands of people who'd pay $25 million to spend a week in a space hotel, and millions who'd pay $5 a week for a lottery ticket to have a one in five million chance of winning such a trip. If Bigalow or anyone else could build such a thing, I expect it would soon be fully booked for years ahead, and he'd have to build another and then another. Costs reduce with scale so as the scale increases, the cost reduces, which increases demand, which further increases scale, which further reduces cost. The next thing you know, a week in space is competing with a week in an up market resort.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-03-03T01:07:15Z	UCK5GUF-twQUjGW5tIedM1PQ	none		Ugy47ZXtb2o9lZf-qWV4AaABAg

"I wonder how many people would actually go to space for a week or 10 days when they actually realize they have to still eat food from a tube, can't really take showers, and have to go to the bathroom by sitting on a vacuum......and the place will stink of body odor. Not to mention you won't have much to do except look out a small portal or read for 10 days.


String enough of the modules together to form a loop and then spin them up and you can then have some gravity. It might be different then. But going from habitat to habitat through multiple air locks might be a major hassle. But you still can't go out unless they build a module with big windows. But still there won't be much to do.....maybe put in a small casino module, movie theater module, etc but not sure how many people that would attract.


But yes....I would go....LOL!

"There’s nothing “eccentric “ about Musk, Bigelow or Bezos. They are visionaries, the kind of people who move things forward and allow our species to progress. The eccentrics are those of us who have either given up on their dreams or never believed in them in the first.

Here’s an excerpt from Theodore Roosevelt April 23, 1910 speech “Citizenship in a Republic”
The Man in the Arena

”It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”"	5nE3UO1kqv0	22	2019-03-01T23:56:25Z	UCr1rCPhbnCDI3NhSi72UEqw	none		UgyXsBr-B8UT1t7QoUl4AaABAg

Although I like many things about Robert Bigelow, I for one, DON'T want to see his concept of inflatable buildings used on the Moon (or space) because Bigelow made his entire livelihood from RENTING HOUSES his whole life.  Thus, he would rent out his hotels on the Moon, making it impossible for lunar settlers to get established.  People need to own property to get established.  The last thing we need are wealthy elites visiting the Moon but lacking the fortitude to eek out a 24/7 existence there.	5nE3UO1kqv0	1	2019-03-01T13:37:01Z	UCiOwNeKcEdtLECqLVdCqYbw	none		UgzVrzjmfP0iYRpUNLB4AaABAg

So Bigelow is now the ""go to"" guy that the U.S. gov't uses for all UFO-related issues.

"Yes. I want to go to 'Bigelow Suites' in space.  Can you loan me $25 million?  That's about $29 per second for a 10 day trip.  Like you said, ""This ain't no Budget Suites"".  Actually, I change my mind.  The windows are too small on those inflatable habs.

Seriously, this was a very enjoyable and informative presentation of what Bigelow is up to.  I've wondering about them lately and was about to Google them, when I saw your YouTube presentation. Great timing!

Also, seriously - I would never subject myself to zero G.  I am highly prone to motion sickness. I know that some experienced test pilots suffer from serious nausea when they go into orbit.

How about some info on that? What percentage of astronauts get nauseous, and how many vomit when they get up into space?  How long does the nausea usually last?  Has NASA or the Russians found a cure?

So I'm curious: They mentioned a lunar orbit base as one goal, and it's clear that one of the big space tourism features of the future will be the free-return, no lunar orbit injection trip round the moon and back. Is there an effective orbit that could put a hotel into continuous trans-lunar orbit, by which I mean a continuous Earth-Moon shuttle perpetually flying near passes by both bodies, that you launch to and dock with and drop back off of at either end? I realize you have to match velocity with it to board it so it's almost as hard as doing your own free-return shot, but I'm wondering if the idea even works with any relatively affordable orbit. Maybe a better question to ask of someone like Scott Manley, but it was this video that brought it up. Speaking of which, if you guys ever start having guests on the OLF podcast, Scott Manley would be great, especially if you brought him on for some topic that gets technical to the point where Tim feels out of his depth.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-02-28T04:41:04Z	UCOU3ECVIvrHZeo3Dhf6vaew	none		UgyN8O37ZBUNfVqF5OZ4AaABAg

That big BA2800 or whatever its called with the big dinning table should be the way to go. More room to walk around and feel like the big ships on movies.  Not the tiny space station we got now where they're packed in like hamsters in tubes floating around.  Long as they don't leak or expose you to radiation the better.  Just have a bunch connected and have a escape pod or a safe room for each one incase a major leak happens.  I think Bigelow and Elon have to team up.  One has the reusable rockets and other has the inflatable housing.  Could have a moon base and a space station gate up in running in no time before we take the greater leap to Mars.  Practice on the moon first since its closer.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-02-27T15:42:29Z	UCl6yjZDCnMpi1AfXKm_9-5g	none		UgzIO9zpOXuDp6aqZSF4AaABAg

I think it'd be cool to go up for a few hours see what all the noise is about.. 10 days in space though.. I think that would be more than most people bargain for.  Gravity does a lot of things for us that we take for granted simply because we've never known how to not take them for granted.  Forget things like fried foods when you're in space.. the sizzling would send showers of grease all over the habitat instead of just being a bit of a mess around your stove.	5nE3UO1kqv0	0	2019-02-27T10:21:34Z	UCm_0o3zxowne95VLXEMIlOw	none		UgxJxpCyZ3JRepiE2K54AaABAg

"The BA330 - just like the ISS is a useless and awful destination. Zero G sucks. Or rather it doesn't suck, which is the big problem. The only way to make space accessible is to have a space station made from TWO- BA-330s, each connected to the end of a 200-metre long truss, with two pressurized cars that run on the truss. Earth-transfer modules dock to the center of the truss, and the cars transfer passengers to one of the modules, always operating in exact opposite motion - both going out and coming in at the same time. It does this so that when the station is spinning, using the cars does not shift the center of rotation.

The cars act as emergency safety vessels and will also transfer people from one module to the other, in an emergency situation.

The idea is that in normal situations, big gyros will spin the whole thing up to yield about 0.5G on the bottom floor of each BA330. This allows people to live normally: showering, cooking, eating, pooping... the list goes on. Zero-G is a terrible thing to be in and no commercial space station is ever going to be successful unless, after the 30 minutes of zero-G hijinks in the docking module at the center of the station, people can retire to the unique low gravity habitation sections, where life is not just bearable, but amazing!

Tourists in a zero-G station will spend their entire trip in misery, either because they're puking their guts out, eating the worst food imaginable, or taking an hour to have a shit, and not being able to bath properly.

No - if you want to make money in space, the station has to produce enough gravity to not throw up."	5nE3UO1kqv0	1	2019-02-27T05:50:23Z	UCs6hNriROONs8sB_78qS8Gg	none		UgxdBkKKP5YhHGhgx1N4AaABAg

"Joe,
Definitely fascinating! Congratulations to Robert Bigelow for taking on the hidden opportunity in those patents.
Ultimately though what’s important to highlight is the recurring theme that we are witnessing since 2015 or so onwards: the partnership of NASA with private individuals. 
This marriage is the catalyst to unexpected opportunities in space and as you correctly pointed out when different technologies converge there’s a sudden leap. 
NASA is certainly the crucible and the human mind from private investors is the new dimension that could not even have been imagined.....just put yourself back when the last shuttle trip took off from Florida.....how dark did it all seem..... 8 years later a totally different platform presents itself to mankind!

Gravity used the energy to convince particles to group together to make my body? How? What kind of energy was that? Show it to me. 

From what I've learned, it is not energy that convinces stuff to move, but mass. 
And mass seems to conserve energy in the strong, weak and EM forces, etc. That's where some of it is hidden. But there is more hidden in places we aren't allowed to look, so nevermind that. Nothin' to see there. Move along. 

So, Protons will collect Electrons using the Strong Force. It takes an ordinary amount of energy to break that bond but when it happens, an exponentially larger amount of energy is released from some additional mysterious hiding place. 

Nothing like this seems to happen when we leave the planet in a rocket. Only the ordinary amount of energy is necessary. Then, instead of exploding, we're free to roam about the solar system intact. 

So, where is this debt?

This guy says billions of years ago the gravitational attraction of the trillions and trillions of dust particles pull themselves together to become a planet!!???? Lmfao 😆😂😆😂😂😂😂😆😂 really?? Which dust particles started it? why weren't these dust particles just pulled into the Sun by fake gravity? It was only a piece of dust. The heat from the Sun been burnt it away in 5 billion years or even 5 million?? These dust particles started orbiting the Sun? Why is that because there was a groove from a fake well? the sun wasn't strong enough to pull in the dust particle but is strong enough to pull in a comet from billions of miles past Pluto??? Lmao 🤣 what is this big giant ball of gas called a gas giant doing in a middle of an infinite void that is a almost perfect vacuum? Why hadn't this gas ball dissipated? Why are there so many things that don't make sense about space? Another is the shadow of the moon is only 70 miles wide on Earth but scientific method shows that you cannot make a Shadow smaller than an object but they can in space! You cannot create gas pressure without a chamber but they can in space!!? Gas balls of flying around 500 million miles an hour in an infinite vacuum. Space doors open up on TV in the air flies out really fast but these air balls or gas balls just stay that way??!!! The Moon and Sun travel the same exact path in our sky and look exactly the same size to us but they say the moon spins around the Earth and the Sun spins around the Moon they still take the same exact path and look the same exact size cuz they say the sun is 400 times larger than the moon and exactly 400 times further away!!?? Just another coincidence? Did you ever get on a Merry-Go-Round? Something spinning very fast like those rides and you can fly right off from centrifugal force or you would stick to the wall but the Earth's spinning at a thousand miles an hour and the centrifugal force doesn't push you away and makes you stick to the Earth??!! all these things are never observable or testable on Earth but they say this is what goes on in space!! We know the moon landings were faked and if you don't watch 'a funny thing happened on the way to the Moon' it's on YouTube and it shows the astronauts faking it. N armstrong and buzz Aldrin.

Gravity is a bullshit term that implies and means exactly what they say, it just is accept it cuz we aren't smart enough just yet to grasp the issue. Its static cling damnit.. much like the static charge of energy of a balloon that's rubbed across your arm will stick. The core is creating the charge. We dont feel it cuz we are born into it. If we had less charge that would mean that we could lift more weight since the static charge is less there. The flux is a static charge that will not affect ones muscle strength or its capability to space	RVMZxH1TIIQ	0	2021-03-07T09:08:56Z	UCJqYgGMguJS8TE6iX-V6hHQ	none		Ugx2GZRo-9nVAFTwFG94AaABAg

"Thank you for knowing all these facts but unfortunately you are very late because Muslims, even the uneducated, knew all what you mentioned since 1500 years. 
In our Holly book ""Quran"" all these facts are clearly mentioned:
Allah "" Our and your only God "" reveals to humans and other parallel creatures the above facts in the following verses in Quran:
"" We created them and we firmly imprisoned them "".
"" O' people and Jin If you can escape through the paths of the earth's skies then try it, but you won't be able to do unless you have power"".
The above verses are examples among many other facts mentioned in our Holly book. 
Someone will ask me now: If my claims are true then why Muslims didn't do these discoveries while the Western nations are nowadays doing without reading Quran?. The answer came also at one verse of Quran where Allah said "" We shall let them, the unbelievers,  discover our evience at frontiers and at themselves so that they know the truth"". This verse clearly tells that discoveries at space and medicine will be offered from Allah to the unbelievers ""non-Muslims"" so that they will finally know that Allah is the only God and should believe that there is no God but Allah."

We've all heard that having all humans on one planet leaves us vulnerable to extinction, takes just one big asteroid. But other good reasons exist. A planetary civilization governed by a single government could turn into a political hell. Or, a disease with a 40% kill rate could start spreading. By building and having off-world colonies, escape becomes possible. Kind of how the New World became that escape for many fleeing political problems and wars in Europe.

Those who created humanity prepared well for the auto-destruction of mankind. Inside each of our chromosomes is capped  a mortality gene that causes us to die within a biologically fixed, pre-determined life span. And then the force of gravity is like a cork that plugs up the bottle that is earth, on which we will all have to vanish once the earth gets destroyed with the inevitable death of the sun. Therefore we are  prisoners on death row in  every sense of what that means, in that somehow humans must be wiped out individually or en masse as a whole.

Energy.. Yea.. Okay - Anyone considering the fact that we are bonded to our atmosphere, food, air, waste elimination, temperature regulation, air pressure, etc?? Mars is losing a quart of air a second. It has no magnetic field around it to deflect the sun's constant bombardment of particles and electrons that would strip away our atmosphere and kill everything on it.

Earth is not flat or round. And Alien lifeforms(would) want to kill , eat , or steal from you.  Space exploration at the size we are is simply impractical. Space is cold , dark , quiet, and big. I mean BIG. Bigger than you are i could dream.  The things that have lapped this universe over enough to know the backroads want the ELEMENTS OUR HUMAN BODIES MAKE AFTER BEING FILLED WITH EMBALMING FLUIDS AND COMPRESSED DOWN LAYER BY LAYER FOR 13 million years. Where do you think our addiction like obsession with Gold , Diamonds , magnetic metalloids and rare gems under the earths surface? We mimic our creators hunger thats why.   Ironically we were created due to our creators hunger so sadly we inherited the habits that brought upon our entire existence and ultimately our demise. Cremate yourself and your loved ones.

Dean Odle has some of the best flat earth videos and several of them. The best videos are censored hard. They even put a disclaimer on all flat earth subjects now to make sure you know it’s a stupid, outdated subject and that you need look no further. Flat earth points us directly to our creator. People, if you think all of the thousands of others who believe in flat earth even though they have to bear a stigma of sounding crazy, if you think they are all just stupid, and you refuse to look into the subject yourself, well then that just makes you arrogant. At least consider if thousands of others are believing it, then maybe at least some of them are of normal intelligence and it’s at least worth hearing the matter, from a good source, there are tons of horrible sources. I’m not saying you must believe, just asking you to consider listening to the matter from a good source. Take care and have a wonderful day!!

"Time - MPH - Distance (will we have to re-calibrate our speedometers and clocks if the earth if flat)
I've calculated a 17.5 miles per hour 'drift'' (precession) 
at the north pole and 1,050 miles per hour at the equator, 
no matter if the earth is presumed to be stationary or whether it is presumed to be rotating.

Three questions are immediate to help me, one pole or two pole, and locations on a FE model(s).
1) one pole or two pole ?
2) position of poles ?
3) daily plotting of hourly sun positions respective to the earth's coordinates.

I intend to see whether I (myself) can show FE as: 
1) stationary (so-called heavens turn), 
or (alternatively)
2) spinning like a record (turns under the so-called heavens)

I can see (only in general, not for how months and days and hourly paths would happen)
on moving FE models how the sun traverses the imaginary meridians/longitude/lines 
of the the ones between the [latitudinal] tropics (imaginary lines) 
with the equator being between the tropics (Cancer & Capricorn), 
which can be used in general to show seasons, but I am looking for the 
actual points the sun shines on the earth at the respective places on earth in relation to 
how I can correlate the 3 models (GE-Helio, GE-Geocentric, FE).

I [thus] also wanted to limit what I am working on (right now) only to how 
time and distance is perceived and measured (by FE model) on Earth
(not how they align with the alleged stars and planets, 
although that probably would be a method of checking 
the daily and monthly/yearly path of any valid/correct FE model correlation 
(so as to be able to say time works the same on FE models as on GE models)."	RVMZxH1TIIQ	0	2020-12-27T10:42:38Z	UCCt-xSaekj59VjrFIHCKuGQ	none		UgzuZyY4NXenW6XI2H14AaABAg

The only problem is that gravity is not a force therefore we cannot talk about energy debt. We are constantly moving towards earth due to space-time curvature near mass, hence the force we need to do to escape earth's gravity is due to a change in kinetic energy.

Seems like the answer is to construct the ships on the moon using materials mined from the moon. If we were to colonise mars, the materials could be brought to mars with a one way trip dump ship that could carry much more than an earth ship due to the moons lower gravity.

Our earth have  a huge electromagnetic shild around our planet, which  protect our planet of all the killer gama rays of the sun .Most likely mankind never leave this prison planet , because we still can not get through this huge electromagnetic shild .Who made it wanted we stay here and never escape .În my opinion Nasa never landed on the surface  of the moon at all, their old moon fotage was a big fake maked somewhere in a hidden studio ,they tricked bilions of naive people with their fake moon landing .Moreover their  moon fotage was ridiculouse a lot ,when they put their US flag on the surface of the moon,then the wind  current blew it,like on the moon could exist some atmosphere.Milions of people's around the world are agree Nasa faked their moon mission it never took place , I have no doubs for sfmyspelling.

"For those in the other Theme, this Video has been recommended to you for a specific Reason! There is a hidden Message behind this! The Truth is, is that the Earth is in Fact a galactic Prison Planet! The Frequencies in the Music from Today are here to programm our Dna, to make us primitive! The Music from today got this frequency ""440Hz"" and that is what makes us being imprisoned on this Planet. Why you ask? Well, the other Alien Races like the Reptilians are here since we came here and they enslaved us with their and out technology from today. They used their higher Technology to block the connection to the higher realms and to bring us to a Point to make us getting earthly Attachments, you have to remove them. Think about it, all these people who got killed, did something good wich was a Sign of ""Danger"", if you know what I mean. It means those who were able to help the Humanity wake up could pose an Error. This whole System we know is here to manipulate us, destroy us and the Planet. These Things have gotten out of Control like these ones. Music from today has become negative, try 432Hz or different Frequencies. Drugs, for a good Reason, to destroy us. Sweets, to block the Energy system, they are just like a Drug, if you don't get it, you'll go crazy. Try birken sugar, it's more healthier. The News, for Implants and manipulation, for Fear, Hate and negative emotions. Doctors with their Pills and Stuff, the Chemicals. Movies and Videos for negative Emotions and for manifesting negative Things. Cars, Ships, Boats, Busses, Planes ..., for the so called ""fresh air"". The Planes got Chemtrails, what are they? Have you seen the Strips in the Air? They posses Heavy Metal and Chemicals, we brave in. The Plastic in the Water in other Lands or more like on the whole Planet should be gone. We Humans have made about 6 Billion metric tones Plastic per Year! Fish, Animals eat Pastic and so do we. Find Solutions to these Things and your Life will become better but don't make your self crazy! And for those who played Fortnite, have you seen the Black Hole Event and the Numbers that has been shown to us? Search for those Numbers on YouTube and put Hz right behind them, like for example ""15Hz"". All other Answers will come to you, be patient. Oh yeah, ""The hidden Teachings of Jesus"".

"Kurzgesast: The Earth is a prison
Capitalism: Well, yes, but actually yes.
Communism: Yes.
Humanity itself: Yes.

Seriously though, humanity is so counterproductive that when one man died, thousands and millions went nuts and killed other humans who had nothing to do with the event, some dying without knowing why they died.
Another time, there was once a dictator who killed 6 million, mostly with gas and society paints him as the worst person to ever walk the Earth even though right now there is a government that won't even allow free speech amongst its own people and has killed more than tenfold in tenfold more brutal ways than that small government. 
There are people who constantly, time and time again, deny the very thing that makes humans ---> human. Innovation, creativity, basically anything new.

Where do all these horrible things come from, you ask? Us. #1 is the George Floyd Riots. #2 is Communism. #3 is what we call ""Karens"", the people who threw the scientists and most brilliant minds of the world into prisons and bonfires, then called them witches because their pea sized brains couldn't handle the truth."

This is a good scientific breakdown but as a born seer, I can also tell you that souls can get out by way of gateways and portals... Certain gateways and portals bypass the earth's gravitational pull and electromagnetic fields... There are portals all around us BUT if we are not 'in-tune' enough to see them or if we are not connected to a 'gatekeeper', we will not be able to get out this way... There are literal gatekeepers here who have the keys and coordinates to portals and gateways... Here's why you all should be kind to everyone you cross because you just might need one of these gatekeepers when your time for potential escape and/or graduation comes.

Because of enthropy we can't draw all the energy from the chemical reactions for the uplift. Since the explosive expansion due to the resulted chemical reaction will be directed in all directions, a huge amount of it will turn into heat due to collisions with other molecules in the same reaction. Only a little amount of energy is used for the uplift. An ideal explosion would be one that all the explosive expansions (at the atomic level) could have the same momentum redirected to only one direction.

What is wrong with you?  I used to look up at this type of programming because you hook the viewer in with the nice sounding intelligent typical t.v friendly sounds and then just abuse people with the black ops content with no regard for the viewers personal growth, or at least you provide growth as if your feeding a pet and limiting the pets potential with how much shit you are providing!  Toxic!  Never a solution in the first place!  Telling somone they never have a way out is not even relivant because they always do!  You shouldn't have this available for anybody. Please be healthy!  Scamming people is not intelligence and cheap tac of back logging making people feel this type of behaviour is used to correct thier past mistakes sounds like a correction program that they would out grow knowing the con because the con stays the same! The human always outlives the con because humanity will always outlast black opporations of cheap wit.

"The speed of matter coming out from the rocket engine should have been mentioned. In theory, there is nothing limiting you use a single electron as fuel and shot the complete rocket out from the gravity well of the Milky Way (or even the local cluster). OK there are some ""minor"" problems, like you would immediately fall apart due to the acceleration , but still, that 100x rocket size is only true, if you're using chemical engines. Use e.g. ion engine, or atomic engine, and your efficiency ""skyrockets""... :) My point is that payload/mass ratio can be much better, we simply don't know how to realize it.
(P.s. I know, the single electron would have a significant mass/energy, which is mass, decreasing the total mass of the rocket, so there is still some limit.)"	RVMZxH1TIIQ	0	2020-07-02T10:07:20Z	UCE_w5WmYr3fBzt86qFG_SHA	none		Ugxboq8xucCfF-gdt7l4AaABAg

I only have one serious question or odd statement to make. I also invite others to comment when they read this to help raise awareness. Is it possible to take a ball that can withstand massive pressure (the ball is actually years and years of researching a gyro-rocket type thing) and pulling it to the bottom of the ocean in order to let the air inside of it propel it upwards into low atmosphere where it is then picked up by a SkyHook which is a concept proposed in another video where low flying objects at relative low speeds can be theoretically pulled away from the earth's gravitational pull via a tether? This would almost eliminate the need for a large quantity of fuel using the natural laws of liquid physics and newton's  laws. plus once you have enough of these spheres in space, you can combine them into a mega structure which can have labs, hydroponic farms, and other rooms for what ever the need may be.

"None of this ""REAL possibilities"" anytime soon, let alone available in an emergency. Do we build this hypothetical ship and leave it ready for escape?  Oh, and about those logistics - artificial atmosphere that can be easily regenerated, water generation in abundance because we're a thirsty lot, artificial gravity so we don't loose our bones, and, most of all, shielding so that our DNA doesn't get shredded by cosmic radiation, will all need creating, not to mention building a ship that can hold all of humanity (or several ships, but even then the weight would be daunting) if the idea is escape from catastrophe and extinction - unless you're planning on leaving most of humanity behind to perish in the impact.  In which case, who decides who stays and who goes?  And what if Alpha Centauri's only habitable (by humans) planet already has occupants? Pipe dreaming is lots of fun, but none of this is feasible or practical in 30 years.  Why don't we concentrate on saving our own planet from being destroyed by US, and work on asteroid deflection technology instead?  And if we're still around by the time the sun starts to run out of fuel in a few billion years, perhaps we'll have this all worked out."

"This is really making me wonder. The schwarzschild kugelblitsz is really interesting because with lasers that powerful we would be able to use the lasers to test Mallets time machine to send messages to the past as far back as was when they're first turned on. So we might theoretically receive the results of any journey from our future selves before we even send the ship. Would we be able to record the messages/information and then give the ship a new target destination or would some kind of quantum eraser effect delete the ""waveform"" of possible information when we observe it?  If we could save the information it would be like a crystal ball that allowed us to literally choose our future by selecting it from possible ones. Even better lets assume by then we have matrix like VR, we could have the information from the future represented there to actually experience it and would essentially have explored everything that was possible for us to explore without actually having to go do it. It would be like a temporal internet where all possible timelines of humanity were contributing to a ""waveform"" of possible information while at the same time never actually contributing. If observing collapses the waveform then maybe you would have to ask a question and some crazy AI that wouldn't be able to actually read the information giving you the answer until ironically we first know the question we need ask in order to preserve the the waveform. The implications to freewill and reality if any of this was possible is really messed up, never mind the fact that if it worked we probably wouldn't be building a ship to physically explore the universe but a computer powerful enough to be able to handle all the possible information. I'm sure there's holes in my thinking but hear me out, what if the solution to the fermi paradox is once we reach the threshold of this laser and information technology we no longer have a need to explore to survive because we could create closed time curvatures containing everything we need and would have no reason to leave the universe we create for ourselves because we would be able to experience what ever we wanted in it."

Bro, I'm a big fan of your show, and i really hate to be the naysayer, but please stop saying we can travel at speeds approaching the speed of light by conventional means. The electrons that bind atoms into molecules which comprise our physical bodies have mass, and therefore cannot reach speed c (light speed.) What is the speed of the electron? A quick internet query states that the electron is traveling at about 2,200 kilometers per second. That's less than 1% of the speed of light. However, liquid fluorocarbon breathing solutions should theoretically reduce cellular damage significantly due to cryogenic pressure changes within our cells. Being that Crocodiles and Tibetan grasshoppers, et al, can freeze and return to life in the spring, this will probably be the most likely means to circumvent (t) for deep space travel. Worm holes and warp drives would be great- but until they are implemented and tested safely, lets please not accelerate ourselves into oblivion. oh and just say no to black holes. thanks!

"@Muttler .. The craft is irrelevant, our technology is the problem. Any journey that would be even years would be too long. We haven't even gone to Mars yet and that's in our backyard, the problem isn't getting there the problem is surviving the radiation and the journey itself.

This is like SETI looking for Radio waves for an ""Advanced Race."" Imagine an advanced race communicating over just 40 light years. ""Hello, did you arrive safely"" .. ""Yes"" .. by the time you received the reply if your lifespan is only 80 years you'll be dead to hear their reply and that's it. No, instead radio is something we use like we used the telegraph until we figure out something better and faster. 

Everything is _space magic_ until we figure it out, and as I mentioned we're right around the corner to AI.

When humans speak about space travel they always talk about different propulsion systems. But space is a substance and a lot of different matter coexist in space. So we need also a very strong shield and maybe an shield is more important than a high speed propulsion systems. An warpdrive seems to be logic, but i don't like to collide with particals, some dust or small rocks. Shielding against the dangers of space, is the most important goal in human space travel.

"I’m trying to incorporate some quantum mechanical phenomena, such as uncertainty, entanglement, and tunneling, into a children’s story.  I’ve seen physicists describe how our world might be different if the speed of light was ten mph.  Along these lines, I was wondering how big the Planck length would have to be to for us to notice quantum effects on a human scale, and what effects might be observed. 
I know such a scenario is impossible because as you said, if you change the fundamental constants of nature too much, the universe as we know it doesn’t exist.  But I’d like to ignore this inconvenient point temporarily, to illustrate the quantum effects.

All of these methods involve traveling at hyper speeds. The one problem with increased speed is you lose internal gravitational impetus.. A mass is held together by its internal gravity,, with every increase of relative speed oof that mass its internal gravitational impetus is lessened. This is the reason comets develop tails, the reason that a rain drop changes its shape into a tear drop instead of a globular mass. The reason that the Earth's magnetic field has a bulge away from our direction of travel. A space vehicle once it reached a critical relative velocity of about two hundred fifty thousand miles per hour would begin to shed its mass in disatttachment of any non permanent attached parts, As its speed doubled it would begin to lose mass as electron and Proton masses. At a million miles per hour it would develop a tail of prptons and electrons which would render the ship into sieve like structure unable to hold an atmosphere.

@Robert Pruitt Most of the comets seen today have such short tails, they aren't discovered until they right at our door step. They just found one during a solar ecllipse. It didn't complete a perihelion passage. Your problem is you can't think for yourself. The Solar wind is composed mostly of protons ejected from the body of the Sun. It normally takes about four days for this mass of protons to reach Earth environs. The mass of a protoon even at nine hundred fifty thousand miles an hour cannot move a grain of sand by a millionth of a mete. This is why disrupting  the orbital path of an Asteroid body is not considered being done by nuclear detonations near to it A thousand megaton nuclear device detonated five miles from an incoming Asteroid wouldn't move it a foot from its path./ Yet these same scientist who know this still publicize for idiots like you that it is solar wind causing the tails of comets to point away from the Sun..     .

Ummm ya, i stopped listenjng at the mention of farts and bill nye. Obviously, to travel huge light distances, you cant be loaded with fuel. You have to have a craft that can generate its fuel and safely. And imagine the pure size of that craft. Like literally, the size of a small continent. However, have we not proved physics, quantum physics or whatever here on earth are not the same in deep space? If we could get into actual space, then start working on light speed travel, otherwise its just trivial BS. We already know we cant achieve it here on earth, but thats not saying we cant in deep space, well because everything is dofferent and reacts different then on earth. Enough of worm holes and crap. We will never have anything so powerful enough to pull two different parts of space together and punch a hole in it to travel. Think about that. Super massive stars so large, out past the orbit of saturn super nova or hypernova cant even do that. That is way more power then we could ever come up with, thats fact. To do that, maybe, just maybe if you had 30 of those stars exploding ar the same exact time, next to each other, then, just maybe then it might cause a blip for a fraction of a second, but unstable. Swim to the center of the ocean with a water proof firecracker and light it. Pressure is so great it might cause a smidge of a blip, but breliefly. Same concept as space. You cant go by europe, grab a pinch of the ocean and bring it towards antartica then causr a hole to travel through. How you grabbing it without a vast source of power and without disrupting everything all around it. You cant. How do you travel back when its disrupelted? Instead of Europe, youd be up by canada instead.Blah, blah, a bunch of wishful thinking without thinking it through.

That wait calculation is stupid just do it and if the other rocket passes it up oh well , and can someone express the fuel all we need is to get to 10% the speed of light then we don’t really need any extra fuel because an object stays in motion unless a force slows it down and Space is a vacuum there’s no air to slow it down	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-12-09T03:48:59Z	UC33LGQAckkHTAMuMMJvZFDA	none		Ugyg6_t7CwkcecFFQ2N4AaABAg

I wish people would pressure their politicians to put more money towards space and NASA. In the 1960’s they received over 4% of the US budget, today it’s less than 0.5% . We need to get back to an era of scientific progress and change. People are too distracted today by social media and the frivolous technology of today.

OR... we could spend that giant money on not destroying it ourselves, accepting the fact that regardless of the aftermath such a crisis, either we+earth are still here, or we’re not. If we are still here after, the implied adaptation needed would most certainly be in the bio/life/chem sciences, for if we don’t adapt, then the space-crisis killed us retro-actively, like what happened to the dinosaurs.

"Singularity thruster sounds super awesome, but what can reflect that much high energy particles in right direction, without messing up the spacecraft with it? Anyways, singularity is a best power source so far, or in this case, an energy capacitor. Awesome.
And we do not see any interstellar empires because it would need a FTL travel technology to simply be able to maintain one, and do a civilization even need an ""empire"" or whatever political structure when it achieves such level of technology? Doubtful. Solves a Fermi paradox in a way. Also, one or two ""great filters"" seems to be ahead of us, because at least for us, humans, civilization requires unprecedental integration, before we can even dream to reach for the stars. Or stop ruining our own homeworld, we can't even leave safely yet. Say, our planet is a spaceship with an enclosed and self-sustained ecosystem, and we have huge fusion power plant in a relatively safe distance, but all we can do now, is build a life boat, not even a one that is habitable in a long run, and it is unclear if there is any other world that we can settle without a long term issues.
Transhumanism may be a solution, so we can survive without any ecosystem, but then we don't need an Earth 2.0, any barren rock will suffice to grind on for materials, and we have plenty in our own solar system. Also this will throw away all cultural, economical and political junk trough the window, along with our humanity, but civilization will remain, and assuming it will not spawn another silly issues along the way."

"""It should be scalable.""  okay, the Square Cube Law kicks in when you try to scale the Light Sail.  Which means if you double the payload, the width (Or diameter) of the sail goes up by a factor of 8.  If you make the payload 10 times heavier, then the sheet has to be 1,000 times as far across, for the same impulse.  So no, it's not going to be scalable.  (Also, as you double the size of the sail, it's mass goes up by a factor of 4.  10 times the width, 100 times the mass.  Not counting the structure to hold it out, and anchor it to the ship.)"

The main problem I have with all these depictions is they conflict. If you compare the grid on a wormhole depiction and the grid of a depiction of gravity around Earth, they do the same thing (minus the tunnel of course) suggesting worm holes have gravity. I think the gravity depictions are wrong. That space time doesn't stretch around mass, instead it compresses. Im considering making this model in a game engine to test its basic viability.

Weird, the higher your degree, the lower your common sense. All these extremely complex technology, just to be a little faster, while the nearest star system is 4 lightyears away, even at 1/10th it's still 40 years at least, but traveling to mars or our inner solar system is a bit faster than usual.

"This plan is contingent on the possibility of using the geosphere's magnetic field to push an atmospherically buoyant space ship into space.

Assemble an atmospherically buoyant flying saucer filled with compressed helium in a fresh water aquatic assembly plant built in the ocean that utilizes buoyancy instead of scaffolding to enable enormous size.  Elevate it above the threshold determined by Coulomb's Law where gravitational force can be overcome by the earth's magnetic field and then transit through space.

Build the ship with an elastic exterior designed for atmospheric buoyancy whose skin can be calibrated in tesla to utilize planetary magnetic fields for lift.

The interior of the flying saucer should be comprised of diminishing rings around a static engine core.  The diminishing rings should function as independent electrical systems with a habitable environment designed to emulate gravity in space.  The rings must rotate independently so that the entire internal space of the habitable structure can be used.  An elevator ride would be first vertical, then lateral in motion and the floors would all curve up a little.  The habitable space would be on the inside of the outer plane for each ring.  Atmospheric stations would be perpendicular to the operating plane.

Rings should be modular and able to assemble into a cylindrical space station after being ejected from the launch vehicle, which can return to my place for a bbq."	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-10-09T07:29:10Z	UCGIojuwmuJSm5BWmuDKb2YA	none		UgyvP7cHSIvcYVVPO414AaABAg

"Astronomers see possible hints of life in Venus's clouds

Posted at 9:23 AM, Sep 14, 2020

Astronomers looking at the atmosphere in neighboring Venus see something that might just be a sign of life.

In a study published Monday, researchers from Cardiff University, MIT and elsewhere say they found the chemical signature of a noxious gas called phosphine.

Two telescopes in Hawaii and Chile spotted in the thick Venutian clouds the chemical signature of phosphine, a noxious gas that on Earth  is onlyassociated with life.

Venus’ phosphine was observed in a narrow, temperate band within the planet’s atmospheres, where temperatures range from 30 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists have speculated that if life exists on Venus, this layer of the atmosphere, or cloud deck, is likely the only place where it would survive, according to MIT.

“This phosphine signal is perfectly positioned where others have conjectured the area could be habitable,” said the study’s co-author and EAPS Research Scientist Janusz Petkowski.

Astronomers tried to figure out other, non-biological ways it could be produced and came up empty.

“It’s very hard to prove a negative,” said Clara Sousa-Silva, research scientist in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).

 “Now, astronomers will think of all the ways to justify phosphine without life, and I welcome that. Please do, because we are at the end of our possibilities to show abiotic processes that can make phosphine.”

"" I thought we'd just be able to to rule out extreme scenario, like 
the cloud being stuffed full of organisms.When we got the first hints of phosphine in Venus' spectrum, it was shock!"" said 
Prof. Jane Greaves of Cardiff University.

Outside experts — and the study authors themselves — say the research is tantalizing but not yet convincing.

Wel if our universe isnt gravity driven most of this is not relevant like for example if the universe has a electric driving force u could maybe use those curents and also maybe get almost instandly get there and there are some real good arguments why our universe could be elecktrickly driven and isnt far fetchs goes they can explain things and calulate things that nasa stil has head pains about because they say its cant hapen in there own model sow just saying maybe our understanding and science could use some tweaks because they are realy stuck in theire thinking mostly if u look ad einsteins law of relativity that even he himselfs being the smartest guy add his time wasnt happy whit it because it could and i repeat could not tie back to reality whit his calculation because the out come evry time veried so muchs it just wasnt right and stil we use that ass a come rule and guide line for space science and stuf and thats in my eyes shocking because science always was suposed to explain things and make calculation u can use in real life to solve things and if it doesnt work also look in completly differend direction instead of just  fucusing on things we now for sow many years bud in the proces of wanting to keep those things  they disproof whit there own not so good or even not aplieable theory things thay could get us ahead like why dismis that the universe could be electric like why because if it is we now add this point in time can get so so far  just saying science is stuck in repeating patorns an add this pase  iam thinken humanity already lost the race because we realy have so muchs years of lost tech that we could had have but now we dont and its sad to see that the main reason for that is just mony and profits because ad the end of the line in our systhem we have here today it just biols down to mony	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-09-13T20:14:49Z	UCD5EnYE-qSVILV7cADSah7A	none		Ugz85mbLpV0vYIptWN54AaABAg

It's definitely possible that there is only one possible value of the physical constants, so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to ask what would happen if the physical constants were different since we don't know if they can be different. I know that, at low energies, the renormalization group predicts a fixed point for a few parameters of the standard model. This means that, at energy scales relevant to us, there might only be one value of particular observables. All values of the constants at high energies evolve towards one value at lower energies. In particular I think the higgs mass might be one of these values, although unitarity also provides strong bounds on the higgs mass. Same for the top quark mass.

"this utub is late in its algorithm. anyway, all this is very nice in Einsteinian universes. we dont need it. The human brain has enough entangled particles to be connected with the most rest of this universe, if you know where you want to go. EG:- other nice planets. Process:- 1/. particle location destination in real time. 2/. stop other particle's spin= connection. 3/. move it to you thru the bulk by wanting it.4/. You are there. Note:- All pairs are connected thru the bulk. ask not why they stop; but when they start to spin again.
Energy:- In the point before the BB., spacetime did not exist, so there was no distance for light to travel. so, no time. Only the bulk and nothing; 2 plates forming the Casimir effect. (2.75degkel- 0degkel.) plates were intradeimensionally flat/ close.(pi4octagonal= 8D). this is constant in this universe, forget about matter/distance/stime.
Utime. past, present and future.

best option with current technology would be to make a nuclear re-actor on the space ship, kinda like submarines today. than use that energy from the re-actor to create a powerful magnetic field around the craft, (kinda reverse of earths magnetic field) this would create thrust using earths gravity as a repel force (hardly any energy used) to lift the craft into orbit , just bouncing off earths gravity, kinda like magnets can repel each other when face a certain way. once in orbit the craft would create a different magnetic field and focusing that field towards another object in space like a star in a different galaxy, magnifying that stars gravity towards the craft accelerating it to light speed towards that star, the magnetic field around the craft would protect the people inside, create the effect inside as if your not even moving, kinda bending space time around the craft, even if you flew through asteroids and what not, it would not effect the craft in any way, would appear to fly through it or it would appear as if the craft is in a different dimension so objects in space would not effect it.

@Katakuri The magnetic field around the ship would increase as the the ships speed increases, countering the forces. Inside the ship people would not even feel or notice they are moving.  Essentially the acceleration forces would curve around the craft instead of directly impacting head on.

"NASA MISSION TO MARS 

Preservance, a robotic wheeled vehicle designed to look for signs of past life on Mars, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Thursday at 7.50 am. It is the third 
spacecraft to Mars this month.

Nasa's preservance mission to Mars which is to touch down at the jezero carter on February18 202.
The new system will allow Preservance to be the first rover 
to "" land with open eyes"" A camera will take picture of the ground as it descends."" This is analogous to putting your hands out in front of and stopping when you feel the ground. 
Previous missions have relied on radar to land .... (it) allows Preservance to look at the ground
compare it to an on-board map and figure where it is"".

so basically Alien travellng to earth is also impossible since the need for 10% of the speed of light is literally the size of the observable universe, then imagine what kind of God like technology you would need to be able to travel as fast as the speed of light, hence and that means it would still take billions or millions of years to arrive here and just to avoid contact? not just that it can't be physical beings since anything travelling at the speed of light can't be. now imagine to travel faster than that. it's just crazy also avoiding to hit on other objects in space. honestly and there are people wasting their time with Alien theories of UFOs  -.-. to travel billion of years to come here and not say hello. is beyond me.

Recording the mind and using robots to scout is the best travel option, because robots can outlive man. When the robots find or work a  planet capable to support us, the robots can spawn organic versions and add records of the mind. Other options may not work because how could the ship or people survive the force of the speed? I believe we were placed by robots and our purpose is to convert Earth for a different form of life. This would explain the default ignorant habits and why the people providing those habits have more money and power. Any E.T. is vary likely a machine until the planet is ready to spawn their kind. We are the worker ants for them. Considering what is, this is the best explanation I have for our insanity.

Gravity propulsion. Lazar told us in the 80's. The technology is known by the worlds governments but we don't have the means to back engineer it or fuel it... (Even if we figured it out) We need to tackle this the only way we know how for now and maybe in a few generations we have the ability to mine far off asteroids, moons and planets. Then maybe we can get our hands on the element that propels these starships and really start to understand our place among the stars....

Interstellar travel is achievable within our lifetime....Juuuust a little optimistic. The nuclear blast destroying our last hope would at least take our minds off our impending doom for a brief moment. Perhaps colonizing Mars and waiting out the dust cloud before returning would be an actual plausible choice? Then the knowledge we gained would get us a step closer to interstellar travel?  Then maybe in the next 2 or 3 hundred years who knows. I got to tell you though. The youth of today seems to have a level of arrogance about the recent advancement in science that common sense eludes them.

"A tiny issue with normal relativistic travel may arise:
The average grain of sand has about 0.011g of mass. At 0.8c, or 240.000km/s, the mass-energy equivalent of a grain of sand impact is in the order of  1.650.000 MJ, or roughly 0.4 Kilotons of TNT. 
So if you hit a single grain of sand in space at that speed, you will eat the equivalent  of 2.5% the yield of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima...  That might cause a slight inconvenience.
I reckon if you run into a dust cloud equivalent to a small anthill spread over a 1m cube or, god forbid, a small walnut sized rock, you'll immediately  sublimate into a flash of gamma and X rays and an expanding cone of fine, charged plasma xD"	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-07-08T10:51:50Z	UCl_kkRAbvH9UQnX2OFbZSrg	none		UgyaEG6I8uCbd_GS8Jx4AaABAg

I think to start with it would make sense to send a generation star ship and get them to Alpha Century in the “ordinary” amount of time, I have drawn one over lockdown that uses light sails which is completely independent of earth, it would house 4 Nuclear powered lasers 2 on each side which is possible since Rolls Royce are bringing out Nuclear power plants that can fit in the back of a Luton Van, so you have acceleration and deceleration, I wish I was a billionaire because I would already be building it and going myself 😂😂	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-06-28T06:24:09Z	UCSHAjLqWcJLeAwmZLPppblQ	none		UgydA3V13uMmmPf6raZ4AaABAg

My best guess is that interstellar travel will only become fashionable when there are already more people living in space stations than on planets and just driving a few of those to another star system in 100 years when your average life expectancy is about a few thousand years is basically just considered to be an adventurous cruise trip on steroids.

Yeah, our labeling for the speed of light is just our perspective of it. It stands to reason to make the /actual/ speed of light to be it's own character which holds a value or idea, like Pi. That would help us understand it on it's terms better than using our perceptions of it, as what we perceive everything to be isn't all that it actually is.

 Klingons are represented by a mirror standing in front of the humans maybe a cult of culture differentiates them  from the romulans (A form of passion driving them both). Tolkien and carl gustav jung may have had a hand in it. Of course that's not what we were talking about but the romulan sub lite engine sounds more problematic then just bottling anti matter.

What if you build a mirror around your kugelblitz? The mirror would reflect the light through the ergo-sphere of the black hole, causing it to gain energy from the hawking radiation and possibly making it a ton more efficient and  requiring a less powerful laser.

"@Sam Burke But making the ship capable of reaching .5 c isn't going to happen soon, and if we don't begin construction until we have the engine, then it'll be even slower in getting anywhere. With today's known tech, and starting today, we could be in any of the star systems within 5 parsec before 2150, which is the timeframe for that other ship's takeoff...

The thing about Big, in space, is that it may have a lower acceleration due to the square-per-cube law (which isn't entirely accurate, by the way, but nvm), but since the Big can go longer between stops and most of the cube part will be fuel doubling as structural material for the early part of the journey, the Big has a greater top speed than the Small.

If what you're looking for is resource gathering inside a system, sure, Small is the way to go. But inter-system, you need Big.
Mind-bogglingly Big.

You say you'd need a fuel tank bigger than the known universe, but what about multiple fuel tanks sent ahead. Take empty ones to the moons in our solar system that have liquid hydrocarbons on them and pick up free fuel. Maybe even a more efficient mixture of fuel than we currently use who knows.  Then, send those fuel tanks off at set speeds so they're at intervals that the ship could pick up on it's trip.  Or send one giant empty one, and use IT to create an enormous blast behind the ship once it gets close to said moon. Or multiples of those. Idfk.  Keep the nukes on board, but it would require fewer, meaning that some could be reserved for slowing down, meaning no space babies?

The problem with an ANTI-MATTER DRIVE is the fact that we haven’t been able to figure out how to actually HOLD AND STORE an ANTI-MATTER particle yet... the second you try to catch it, it vanishes and is gone. No matter what you try it ALWAYS vanishes. So in order to make a working ANTI-MATTER DRIVE, we would HAVE to make a drive that propels it’s self AS ITS MAKING THE ANTI MATTER at the same time and using it at the same time! So that basically wherever your producing these anti-matter particle’s at is ALSO the ANTI-MATTER FUEL LINE so that as each anti -matter particle is made it INSTANTLY gets used. But all of this is pretty much impossible to do because there’s no way to make a particle accelerator small enough to launch into space.... BUT maybe there’s a way to launch pieces into space and build a particle accelerators in space because space is a PERFECT VACCUM, which we need in order to make are anti matter!

The black hole propulsion makes absolutely no sense, from the momentum conservation aspect for a start, if you could use the black hole radiations and repel them, then you better just use the lasers and fire them backwards or reflect them of the fire from a distant location.

I would love to see humidity explore the universe and colonize other planets. Im really interested what’s out there. Most of us probably won’t be around for us to see or visit another star. Either way even if I had the opportunity some how I wouldn’t want to leave.

"2:45 Wouldn't this phrasing be more accurate?  ""Propel a lot of mass backwards, or *Propel a lot less mass at higher speeds* ""

Reasoning:  Mass only _linearly_ affects kinetic energy.  Speed *quadratically* affects kinetic energy (K=mv^2).  Plus, even less mass is needed to accelerate the reduced fuel mass.

And indeed, this is qualitatively what we see in rockets, (and is explained in the video too):  When going from chemical rockets to fusion rockets, the amount of fuel (mass) goes from the size of the Universe down to several tons, while the fuel speed maybe increases by 30x."

What is so amazing to me is, Bob Lazar, the guy who claimed that US has working alien UFO in its possession, said in the 1980's, that UFOs use gravity engine to bend space-time and it could travel FASTER than speed of light. And yes, according to general relativity, Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equation, it is entirely possible that traveling faster than speed of light, if you find out a way to bend spacetime. Also, according to Bob Lazar, he saw the evidence of this. When he saw the UFO up close, and looked at it from the bottom, UFO became invisible, due to space bent around the vehicle. This is really an amazing detail, and I believe him 100%. Watch his interview here and let's discuss. https://youtu.be/BEWz4SXfyCQ	EzZGPCyrpSU	3	2020-04-13T16:26:35Z	UC2cCiRtxIxxoe9M93e5zPtA	none		Ugxqp-2VqCrNHOW9s9t4AaABAg
@Nikita Kuznetsov Probably not, the lorentz factor, sqrt(1-v2/c2), becomes imaginary number, rather than pure negative, so special relativity just breaks down. Like conservation of mass is not really valid anymore due to e=mc2. Scientists pretend humans know a lot already, but we have had this kind of knowledge for couple hundred years only. Humans have existed for 300,000 years. We have long long way to learn. And I think special relativity will be replaced or modified within couple hundred years as well.

Elementary logic dictates humanity's PRIORITIES: First, we must REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS enough in the next 25 years in order to AVOID a runaway greenhouse effect. Two, we must build asap the necessary infrastructure on the Moon to mine Helium-3, which can supply us with free energy for 10,000 years. Three, we must build independent permanent human settlements on Mars asap, so if civilization on Earth becomes extinct, the Mars settlements can survive. Four, humanity must then take the far more difficult step to the outer solar system, build settlements wherever possible, and start building the requisite tech to reach another star. We have about 2-3 billion years before the Sun runs out of hydrogen, starts burning helium, swells, incinerates the Earth, shrinks to a black super-dense mass, and dies. The trip from cave-dwelling to Moon-walking proves that we have the POTENTIAL to survive the Sun's death, spread across the Milky way and other galaxies, and then to other universes, across the eternal multiverse. amazon.com/John-Likides/e/B00JJ3B2LA	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-02-25T04:09:38Z	UCqGDkbOc24nfpe7ZUqg66RA	none		UgzdhHQTHlXdm8j99xh4AaABAg

"So if we could, in fact, achieve 1/10 the speed of light to realistically get us to Alpha Cen in a few years, do we also have the technology and ability to create an environmental control system inside the hull of the ship to provide gravity and to counteract the incredible G forces that would presumably crush us into dust? And what about navigation? Would we have the ability to ""steer"" or otherwise control the ship? Obviously computer control is primary, but do we have the computational power and speed to keep us going on the correct course at these speeds? This is uncharted space after all, so it's not likely its going to all smooth sailing. A few ppl have said without some type of shielding, the hull would be destroyed by space debris. I commented on another post, I wonder if, using the artificial black hole method of propulsion, could some of the Hawking Radiation be channeled around the outer hull to provide some level of protection."

I was thinking if we can create a technology where we can encapsulate a starship within a beam of light, then shoot this beam of light at the nearest star Alpha Centauri @ 4.367 light years from Earth, we can achieve a velocity of 100% light speed and reach it in 4.367 years.  Of course we have to de-capsulate/decelerate the starship before reaching the destination at a safe distance.  I call this the Particle Photon Encapsulation (PPE) Drive - a starship (particle) contained within a stream of Photons and riding it like data in optical fibre at the speed of light to the nearest star.  This of course would be a one way trip because we need a powerful light cannon to lauch the ship to the destination.  However, if we can make the starship generate it's own beam of light in the direction of travel and then encapsulate itself into that beam, then we can do away with a launch pad and the starship can travel freely.  The starship is made out of particles (matter) and light is made out of photons (energy), so this kind of technology has to be able to encapsulate matter within energy - the reverse of the natural phenomena where energy is encapsulated (contained) within matter.

This will be fun... The theoretical Alcubierre warp drive can move faster than 'C'... Because physics does not limit the speed of any individual piece of spacetime compared to any other piece... I want to offer a seed of thought. - Gravity moves faster than 'C'. - The old mental experiment... If the sun just vanished... We would see the sunlight for 8(+) minutes... It has been put forward that the Earth would continue to move around where the sun was at for that same 8(+) minutes because the gravity from the sun would also last that long... Because of the speed of 'C'. But if gravity... The warping of spacetime, moves faster than 'C'... The Earth would fling out of orbit faster than the visible light from the sun would vanish. - A gravity wave (or ripple in spacetime) is in effect an Alcubierre-style warp, with no laws of physics limiting it's speed. - I have some possible consequences to this thought. - Let's follow the birth and evolution of a particular gravity wave... I'll call him Gerard. Gerard is formed by the orbits of two massive objects and radiates outward. He behaves as we have learned that he behaves... But at the point where we think that he has expanded (or dissipated) to being ineffective to the matter that he encounters... The actuality of his existence is something different. He joins a vast 'flow' of every bit of gravity ever birthed... And contributes to this flow. Amplifying the other gravity waves... As he is also amplified. This flow has eddies and back-washes where matter accumulates... And becomes (among other things) galaxies. The matter that grows in these eddies of gravity 'flow' can be seen to move too fast for its own gravity and we think it should be spinning itself apart... But actually, the gravity that keeps the galaxies together is from the outside 'flow' - Not the inside mass. - Dark matter does not exist... When we map the areas where we see more gravity... and call it dark matter... What we are seeing is the 'flow' of all the gravity that was ever birthed. If we want to move to other parts of this galaxy - And even to other galaxies... We need to harness this 'flow'... And surf. :)	EzZGPCyrpSU	0	2020-02-18T09:16:01Z	UCYa62bxeQEc9-TLzVKCMYFw	none		UgywPzZj4wiuT4brfUR4AaABAg

To conserve fuel and or energy, why not just hitch a ride with an asteroid. Setup station there while traveling into the abyss of space. Maybe do some sort of mining on the asteroid. Once you get far enough start looking for other asteroids that have further paths and so on. As far as sending humans, that’s the challenge. We need all the necessities we have here on earth. To try and eliminate some of the necessities, we would need to make ourselfs half robot or something. It’s all possible we just haven’t thought of it. And it’s not expensive that’s just an excuse to keep us here. Money is worthless.

With how fast technology is advancing I would say anything we would do/start today would be significantly slower than future methods that would get there before anything we started/launched today.  Also, this most likely end up being a complete waste of time as something would go wrong.  The ship would fail, everyone on it would die, there would be a terrible accident, or maybe worse yet... we arrive there safe and sound only to find there is something about the planet that makes it uninhabitable for us and everyone dies.

Few words about The Stick. Upon landing all seats automatically switches in another position and central seat becomes closer to buttons - not for comfortable clicking, but for more safer landing. In other stages that position (closer to buttons) not optimal for crew.

What I find simply confusing is the fact that none of them seemed to flinch or react to the sudden acceleration from 0 to 1 million miles per hour in no time at all.

The Russians are not concerned about all the unnecessary luxury in a space craft. They are very pragmatic in their approach to science and technology. I believe the western public is unaware of these, but our governments are, that's why they walk a delicate line with the Russians. Plenty of the extra cost in launching an American or European space craft comes from layers of bureaucracy and of course the capitalist model of handing finances. Higher price tag does not always mean higher quality or more reliability. I see people for instance comparing the strength of different countries' military by thier military budgets. And that is bad analysis because countries with inflated cost of labor and production will seem to be spending so much on military whereas countries with lower cost produce the same quality and type of military gadgets at a far lower cost. That is in effect the story between the United States, Russia, and China. And our experts know it, so they thread a fine line with this countries despite media hype of our great strength.	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-09-08T11:43:13Z	UC9ZfXNBHxeHGa0E_wnkIYSw	none		UgxOpluJhM5ma6FstHR4AaABAg

Sorry I’m an idiot, I’m just learning about this stuff now. But once the spacecraft gets into orbit is it still being propelled by rocket engines to get to the ISS?

The timing of the launch is critical to get the rocket in the correct trajectory to be able to intercept and rendezvous with the ISS. If the launch has gone to plan, the main rocket engines aren't used again. It is just a matter of fine-tuning the trajectory with small bursts of the manoeuvring thrusters as it gets closer to the station.	fr_hXLDLc38	2	2020-06-16T09:05:17Z	UCgjgSWz6Bu8Brw7-vEd1dCA	none	Ugxf7H11-DIHV2vrYm14AaABAg	Ugxf7H11-DIHV2vrYm14AaABAg.99rdHnnaz-z99xt7VIT1YD

For obvious reasons we do not discuss the sex life of our employees, but you are right these topics are high in the list of research areas. It is easier and more logical to study reproduction in space in smaller organisms with shorter generation life spans to study long term effects. In plants researchers are studying  Arabidopsis thaliana https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Research/Plants and fruit flies are common insects to study as they have short lives and reproduce quickly.	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-06-04T08:42:45Z	UCIBaDdAbGlFDeS33shmlD0A	none	Ugwwx2C4wYnvIkyzcmh4AaABAg	Ugwwx2C4wYnvIkyzcmh4AaABAg.99TeChK-AR099Tx-zikbNQ

I am sure that SpaceX is is future of space travel but i think there is no reason to say Souyz is crap because it looks old. Elon love futuristic designs so it is clear that his next gen space stuff must be cool but when you realize what year Souyz was made and was made for functionality and not for looks it is not that bad. Because Soyuz is really reliable and safe there was no reason for them to make whole new rocket with modern design. If Soyuz was not good and safe i doubt USA would pay those astronomical prices for seats.	fr_hXLDLc38	1	2020-06-03T11:18:57Z	UCjbTvGbXwlPGzUSro19qWRQ	none		Ugyna1qTmFEIb0O4yh54AaABAg

They have a rudimentary space toilet in the habitation module, which is a larger, more comfortable module behind the narrow one you see in the video. It can't be used during launch and reentry but for the rest of the flight (which is most of the time). The toilet is just some suction pipe hidden in the wall, so it's really primitive, thus everybody will avoid using it unless it's absolutely necessary. Their suits do not have any kind of plumbing and are also only worn during launch and reentry, because they're quite uncomfortable and offer no additional security while flying through space. So a plumbing system inside of them wouldn't make too much sense. It's possible that they're wearing some kind of diapers while using their suits, just to be safe, but I don't know about that.	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-06-03T14:13:01Z	UCv7dtFOyjxyjdkAYfCb4Mng	none	Ugy2r1_bKJ-aba5Q88F4AaABAg	Ugy2r1_bKJ-aba5Q88F4AaABAg.99RYA-BNuTb99Ry03uOsfM

@Karl Strud Every reason to upgrade. You can't halt technological improvements when something just works. And the reason why the russians are cheap because they are russians. The dragon is designed to be more comfortable and has modern sytems build in place. And was even inspired by the soyuz. Not to mention that dragon is the reason for america to be america again instead of being dependant to another nation. PLUS its commercial and not government which means prices will eventually go down. AND renewability. In the past launching rockets was expensive as hell because the material got lost. Thanks to spaceX we now have reusable rockets. And because spaceX is a commercial company. They will ofcourse create many more type of rockets and other crazy stuff to improve space travel. Like the new starship which ofcourse has some development trouble. But that's ok because space engineering is hard and you rather want to detect problems before rather then after.	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-06-03T21:42:14Z	UCuxZ3s99UCcwJTMkvmWz6Zw	none	UgwT1qYs7mBFaH-2a_p4AaABAg	UgwT1qYs7mBFaH-2a_p4AaABAg.99MtyJfe82Y99SlQCBrrh-

It's no the gravity but acceleration. The spaceship is still only 200 km from the surface of the Earth after 9 minutes but it's going fast enough to miss the Earth while falling down.

Because they bring a looot of stuff with them, far more than the space x one. These soyuz are incredibly effective and safe, they bring people into space since the 60’ and now take with it all the stuff needed in the ISS.

Funny enough both NASA and the Soviets used either mechanical pencils or grease pencils at first. Once Fisher (a private company) developed the pressurized space pen NASA adopted them in the late 60s (they payed 6$ per pen) and the Soviets bought them as well to use them on Soyuz.	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-05-30T20:45:26Z	UCAS1YFFvFGuM866aE9OKXew	none	UgyYeR1_wAyI_6CWHuJ4AaABAg	UgyYeR1_wAyI_6CWHuJ4AaABAg.99CAVCqK3sQ99IMjdRAZ8d

It's funny to think that, without the Earth's gravity, they wouldn't be able to achieve orbit and fall around the globe. And if there was no gravity affecting the craft while in 'space', they wouldn't be able to return. I often wonder if it would feel different being aboard a craft while outside the Earth and Sun's SOI. Technically then, as long as we were outside the SOI of any neighbouring star, planetary body or satellite , we truly would be in space.	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-05-19T18:49:15Z	UCAsh-QdF_ftqgZdDLURZGSA	none		UgypIzAE6h9dbUGMEPN4AaABAg

"I remember some of the colour-TVs back in the 80s, they had big buttons on them to turn on/off, as well as for choosing channel. A guy I know, used a broomstick to flip the switch by the floor to on, and used it to change channels also. The broomhandle was lovingly nicknamed 'The russian remote'.
Newer model TVs had knobs you had to turn to switch on/off or change channel, that's when my older brother and me became 'the russian remotes' and we'd run back and forth to turn on the tv, or change channel or change volume. 🤣"	fr_hXLDLc38	0	2020-03-22T00:28:02Z	UCJYWlA-t-ESq2YBBr8tAxxA	none		Ugwi0XddhmBIDYnUkth4AaABAg

Except... That's not how orbital mechanics works. The transfer window between objects is never when they are the closest together. Since everything in the universe is moving. Unless you're being really inefficient, the amount of time it will take to travel to another star is allways going to be half of the time it takes the sun to orbit Sagittarius. If you try to go faster you'll just have to do a lot bigger capture maneuver. And there is absolutely no way that a gravity assist off of any object in the proxima centauri system can even get close to capture. So all of this is Bullshit.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	1	2021-02-16T12:35:28Z	UCj-sR15_TNnrEcXnjKl0Wbw	none		UgylwMFxQlQRi4hemOh4AaABAg

No, it's impossible. The only reason why we can detect things like pulsars and black holes is because they gravitationally bend light around them. Scientists aren't even confident that proxima centauri B exists since they have never directly observed it. What scientists actually do is observe the stars brightness and if they notice even a few photon change in brightness, then that means there is a planet in front of the star. This is a hugely flawed system as determining its size, shape, nature and location and eccentricity is next to impossible.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2021-02-16T12:43:34Z	UCj-sR15_TNnrEcXnjKl0Wbw	none	UgxfYhS1v_PqegdpM0t4AaABAg	UgxfYhS1v_PqegdpM0t4AaABAg.9JZcX53bied9Jp7rdtFm3j

"@Charles Murray It's going to require something that isn't present in nature, it would require an intellectual being to figure out how to bypass nature's limitations. If we discover it, it would be by discovering alien life who had invented or discovered it before us. Alternatively, it's up to us to invent it.

You could argue that humans are the universe's way of thinking about how to hack itself. So maybe we're not discovering, merely doing a natural thing. But that's not the point I guess, we'd still have to put in the work to make FTL-travel reality."	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2021-01-27T09:14:37Z	UCYT2dpGpK-UcQFdiTKc8sfQ	none	Ugy-puVSFTwyiq6AGuJ4AaABAg	Ugy-puVSFTwyiq6AGuJ4AaABAg.9Iyn2OHMu059J0G2k6gDKp

"Here's something random you might want to read :
Life does exist but an intelligent life is just rare , so there might be a stone age life out there that might turn into an intelligent life but hear me out it took us so long just to get here , like the start of life to today's life . So Im guessing that were not going to be able to find another intelligent life done we might be the only one or that other intelligent life is just far away from us 
And you may be asking ""how about those ""UFO's"" well it might be an optical illusion or it's probably something like an edit beacuase a spaceship that is like the size of an F-18 can't even travel from galaxy to galaxy , because of course fuel well there might be a Somekind of new technology but at the same time some of those ""UFO"" reports manage to break the laws of physics and if we ever receive a radio signal or something from another planet , that radio signal might be something like 50,000 years old from an intelligent life that extincted a really long time ago

And the only way to find an Intelligent life by just looking at a planet is finding at least a satellite or something orbiting the planet that looks like a man made object.

"If we stop investing in space TRASH... those ships we just throw away or disgard as trash after one or two uses, including those of boosters, and invest in technology allowing the ship to enter/exit our orbit at will multiple times, or even start investing in a Space bound Star dock like we've seen in movies and star trek shows? We could eventually invest in a self sustainable Star Ship. Not like the star gazer that Elon musk is building through space x, a stand up rocket that can land and be reused?? I mean a star ship with gravity thrusters, lays out like a Carrier does in the water... 

Than we can start saving more for the future and stop wasting our resources on trash every few years!

"Well the space program died when LBJ and Nixon decided to spend $2.5 Trillion on a war with Vietnam. Who’s only claim was to stop living in outright poverty.   I believe space exploration will never recover from this waisted opportunity. We should have had a Mars base by now,  a moon base should have been in the 80s.   Now I feel that extreme weather in the apocalyptic 50s of this century will seal the end of humanity, at least as far as what we call humanity.   We had a very slim timeline to set up bases and push for colonisation. We were doing fine with the first moon landing 66 years after the first airplane, ( heavier than air ),  but now it’s said it will be 2035 for further exploration. That’s another 66 years.  So what have we done in this time.  Lots great science,  but lots of great science has been done throughout human history. I’m talking about proper space exploration,  actually creating working habitats on foreign worlds, the type that will save our race from that inevitable self destruction that has claimed nearly every single species that exists or will exist on other planets.  We just didn’t get off this rock in time and that is the one test all civilisations have to pass and if you don’t, if you have leaders who look inwards and not outwards and if these leaders prefer killing poor people rather than save the human race, then we are doomed.   All of science and art has all been a preparation for the human race to evolve.  From the first cave painting to the Apple iPad,  we are here to complete a journey.  But on that journey,  the leaders that be,  had no understanding of its importance and this happened at that most critical moment,  the early 1970s.  I remember being emotionally connected by one of our ancestors,  who after painting the incredible 3D images in the Chauvet Caves,  the young artist dipped her hand in red dye and slapped it on the wall.     It was a message from 36000 years ago, it was this.          “That’s it from me,     now it’s over to you”.      
 One cave had a star map.   Can you imagine these ancestors looking up to space.  They pointed the way.  The space race started nearly 40000 years ago.  Somewhere near the finishing line,  society has lost its way.   As the Descendants we owed it to our Ancestors,  to finish the job they started,    so long ago."	3zMUJwGrn6Q	1	2020-09-22T15:43:24Z	UC05xrZl5OdqKc4LazJpPvSw	none		UgyWGz9Yx5681sb09mt4AaABAg
I'm 70, give or take, so no star travel for me.  It's only possible if 'they' exist and need some pathetic human subjects for their med school or museum.  Now, if you're 20, we could reach Proxima Centauri, but only if it was a national priority.  We'd have to build an accelerator, probably spanning the moon.  The space capsule, unbelievably tough, virtually solid, would eventually be raised to 50% of the speed of light before it escaped thru the magnetic containment, in the direction of Alpha Centauri star system.  So, if that 20 year old lives to be 80, we have 50 years to build the centrifuge/accelerator and star ship.  At 1/2 the speed of light, it'd take less than 10 years to get there.  Then we'd just have to confirm our success via radio or tracking.  Easy, now, wasn't it?  Oh, the cost?  About the same as the yearly defense budget...	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-09-21T22:06:31Z	UCgc3EcjZXF5vsbN2aQiypXQ	none		UgznDs-xQfY7Ls2CO2J4AaABAg

We'll probably do something like Starshot, but probably not in the tmeframe some here would like. I think that what will drive space exploration in the near-to- medium term is profit -- There's enormous wealth in asteroids, and extracting it will require the colonization of space, rather than the colonization of planets. We'll very likely see a lot of O'Neill habitats in Solar orbit and underground mining settlements in the larger objects.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-08-31T01:59:37Z	UCs-EyJX7QFZzR9k3sz9EeNw	none		Ugx1_odLLlURVkejXpV4AaABAg

Why don’t we go to Mars first? 🤣 We were supposed to have done that by the 80s after we went to the Moon FIFTY YEARS AGO. We haven’t done didly since. Why?  Because we can’t or we would. It’s not that much money that everyone says. All the Space Shuttle and ISS stuff was a regression not development or advancement when you consider all that was done in low earth orbit. Big deal!

I'm not saying we shouldn't invest in this sort of thing, reaching and exploring exoplanets like this and sending data back, if at all possible... we should. But I feel like it's more important in the short term to try to develop as much real estate in our solar system as possible before we entertain fantasies of colonizing supposedly earth-like planets that are very far away and we actually know very little about. Colonizing and/or terraforming Mars is a nightmare, but at least we know what the specific engineering challenges are and we can work towards overcoming them, if we commit to it. And the distances are short enough to adapt and adjust, and maintain something resembling supply lines with Earth. Colonizing proxima centauri b is likely a one way trip, and if preparations weren't handled perfectly it becomes a suicide mission. Again, likely not the point of the video, but if we have to decide where our space exploration money goes it might matter someday which projects get the better PR.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	1	2020-06-02T06:04:34Z	UCMsNJE4d_qZh6eiS1lEJXRw	none		UgxQp87CKZGCdWGJlJF4AaABAg

The Wait Equation Paradox says that human knowledge is expanding at a rapid pace and we are on the tailwind. So you launch something in 2036 that takes twenty years, then there should be something in say 2041 that only takes ten year. So you get there in 2051. And the laser sails were a monumental waste. Of course we have to go at some point. But travelling that distance, odds are the first to leave will not be the first to arrive. And for fans of the sails, how do they report back? I haven't read all the information on them. So that is a legit question. Can anyone explain?	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-05-19T04:48:44Z	UCkWYOnWAkv5z2FulUHlBo-g	none		UgwwUk1i7ysO-yrOhKF4AaABAg

Ocean floors for example, are mostly unexplored. Go explore them. They are here on Earth. You might say ""well, it's too risky"". Well, do you know how many thousands of people died on voyages when they were discovering islands and continents? It's a part of the game.

Another of humanities frivolous endeavor.  To what end? To prove to ourselves that we can do it?  Who cares?  10 Billon dollars invested on Earth's most precious resources will do much more than wasted efforts to see what's on the next horizon in space.  I'm all for science and discovery but not this way.  The stars and the universe can wait  for another day when human beings has developed better and cheaper technologies to carry them to a journey of self discovery.  But for the present moment it behooves human to learn how to be a good steward of their planet Earth and in doing so the stars awaits them.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-04-24T07:34:51Z	UChLx-vWx4R0bjgfs8v6YN1g	none		UgxPKLPsZRLtnvxHpQF4AaABAg
"As I have said many times, take this quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson into consideration:
Imagine a group of people who live in a cave, and in that cave they have problems. There's a shortage of food. There's a need for firewood. Outside the cave, there's a valley, and within that valley there may be edible plants, there may be trees. So one day a cave-dweller asks: ""I wonder what's outside the cave?""

But elders of the cave reply: ""Before you go exploring outside the cave, first you've got to solve the problems inside the cave."" And that could be a problem if the solutions to the cave's problems all lie outside the cave. Tyson wonders if this is the situation we face in America today.

""We wage wars over resources on Earth,"" he says. ""But the universe is a limitless source of resources. There are asteroids in space where these resources are not rare. They're common."" Folks who insist we can't invest in space exploration are like the cave elders. They say we can't look to the stars for solutions, because we've got to ""keep looking down at our Earth problems and solve those first."""	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-05-06T06:42:22Z	UCUSQfYm67XTCzgFZYwGaWIA	none	UgxPKLPsZRLtnvxHpQF4AaABAg	UgxPKLPsZRLtnvxHpQF4AaABAg.97pFdmgR6gN98J3AsmSkix

What we should be doing is cutting the military budget by 1/3rd and then investing that money into NASA.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-04-05T09:31:42Z	UCZbBwNgXE07h7hMmgUINPsQ	none	Ugw5jAuJiUPIDTtKqg54AaABAg	Ugw5jAuJiUPIDTtKqg54AaABAg.973NDYMryJH973Xuw4Zckb

1000 ships sounds awfully few given the speed and obstacles they could encounter in 20 years of travelling. I assume the chance of success is really low. Also how do they plan on collecting data from a ship travelling at 20% light speed, I imagine normal photography won’t really bring much and it would probably take an awful lot for any small piece of data to even reach earth back	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-02-08T15:18:26Z	UCjD0-WFuU-IMLR8053CVbqw	none		UgwXNZAXZyjap3P_FFl4AaABAg

"The major problem is that propulsion – shooting mass backwards to go forwards – requires large amounts of both time and fuel. For instance, using the best rocket engines Earth currently has to offer, it would take 50,000 years to travel the 4.3 light years to Alpha Centauri, our solar system's nearest neighbor. Even the most theoretically efficient type of propulsion, an imaginary engine powered by antimatter, would still require decades to reach Alpha Centauri, according to Robert Frisbee, group leader in the Advanced Propulsion Technology Group within NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
And then there's the issue of fuel. It would take at least the current energy output of the entire world to send a probe to the nearest star, according to Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. That's a generous figure: More likely, Cassenti says, it would be as much as 100 times that."	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2020-02-07T00:13:44Z	UCUoJaKjHyAxIuPqtAW5vdbw	none		Ugxj7JU1dqUiqX4bV_x4AaABAg

"Although I find space fascinating I don’t understand the disappointment with not being able to “explore the universe.” First of all, there’s plenty of earth you haven’t personally experienced so it’s still new to YOU, even if other people have experienced it first. In fact it’s best that other experience it first - they are the ones at greatest risk of being killed by some unknown danger.

Second, the universe is unbelievably vast and there are no signs of life anywhere. So for all we know, a person could theoretically get on a spaceship and travel vast distances only to arrive........nowhere. No civilizations to discover, no new technology to learn about, just empty dead space in every conceivable direction. Where exactly would one be trying to go if discovering outer space?

How would the photos be sent back to earth without any degradation? 4+ light years is a heck of a distance to transmit the data even using a relatively high powered antenna which these probes won't have. Unless some of the probes are able to stop part way between Earth and Proxima Centauri and act as signal boosters...but I don't see how that's possible without the probes being able to decelerate with no gravity assist. Or is the plan to have the probes return to Earth after X days/months even if that doubles the mission length?	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-12-13T19:22:47Z	UCO-hATCTN9j54ODnoQoNlNQ	none		Ugwhlj7wxcqPwZFo4wp4AaABAg

So no discussion of how a centimeter scale spacecraft is going to communicate with Earth at 4 light years distance.  No discussion of how they'll be powered.  No discussion of how they'll make course corrections or be so accurately aimed during their 20 minutes of boost that they'll come anywhere near proxima centauri, especially since the exact location of proxima isn't known to high precision.  No discussion of how difficult it would be to have anything survive the incredible G-forces required to get to 0.2 lightspeed in 20 minutes.  No discussion of how they keep from incinerating the spacecraft when they illuminate it with 100 GW of laser light? And especially no discussion of the incredible difference in the scale of the problem when you talk about trying to send humans there and the impossibility of doing it the same way as described in this video.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-10-23T11:06:55Z	UCjTtVHmS8btpW756EuWTafA	none		UgxvAa7urjs4jw7hoO94AaABAg

Not in 10 lifetimes. Too far. The fastest thing is the Helios 2 traveling at 150,000 miles per hour. A hypothetical ship traveling that fast still takes 19,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri. Speed of light travel is science FICTION, a fantasy for young comic book gamers who haven’t gone very  far in formal math and science courses, maybe the 6th grade.  But articles in Popular Science and others say different. Spoiler alert- it’s fantasy. We don’t spend money for real development because there’s no money in it for commercial use. Musk ship is a joke. Big deal. Going up into low earth orbit is nothing. Been doing that since the 60s.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-10-12T19:29:42Z	UC747Zm2dwhHpFKvCwOXejBw	none		UgxrjDrJgWlbbnA_cXF4AaABAg
Note though that humans won't be travelling at 20% speed of light, since human body is nowhere near capable of handling accelerations like that (20% of speed of light in 10 minutes is around 100k g, when modern aircraft limits its acceleration to 9-10 g since pilots pass out when beyond that, and even then they need training to handle it consistently).	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-10-12T19:27:50Z	UC-DXvzgkL-nqADgpRWBCzEg	none		Ugy68OZXoM4wMmaQz0R4AaABAg

"Weeping Angel Why is it against natural laws for us to reach another star?  First of all, humans defying gravity is unnatural. When Humans travel to space, they experience lots of problems physically, why? Space, is not humans habitat, Earth is humans habitat. Would you consider a cow flying to the moon as natural?

The closest star is 4.25 light years away.

Travelling at the speed of light requires us to travel 669,600,000 MPH. Humans have only ever travelled a max of around 20,000 MPH. Humans will NEVER be able to travel at the speed of light, nature has made it this way for good reason.

There's nothing within the laws of physics that prevent us from going to other star systems, the only thing it prevents in this regard is travel at the speed of light which isn't a necessary in interstellar travel.
It take tens of thousands of years but eve if we give up the hope of exploring further than we already have(wonder when that's ever happened). Voyager 1 and 2 *will* be reaching other star systems if they are't intercepted. As said before, it may not be humans getting there but it is certainly part of humanity having originated from here from us. 
It may not be in the forseeable future but humanity will reach another star system."	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-09-25T07:15:40Z	UC-zDby1R_C8mu-9I_BehbPQ	none	UgzSu2ImKl3Aj3FOivB4AaABAg	UgzSu2ImKl3Aj3FOivB4AaABAg.9-A5dV2xCpG9-IKvk2po1O

"1.  If we do get it off the ground,  it would only be a fly-by, and when you consider Pluto is around 4-5 light hours distant, this thing will be in and out of that system in 24 hours.


2.  Each spacecraft will have to be able to communicate over 4 light years distance, even though it weighs only a few grams.  Don't know how they can pull off that trick, especially since that means the craft will have to orient themselves toward Earth to transmit.


3.  Presumable each craft will have to have way of maneuvering to accomplish the above, as well as power.  Nuclear?  1000 nuclear reactors in low Earth orbit during the staging period?  Wonder how that will fly?  Literally and politically.


4.  Additionally, each craft will have to have some sort of scientific package.  Since they're sending 1, 000 of them, each craft won't have to carry the same package, hopefully, they can specialize, so as to get more instruments to the destination.


5.  Will one of the payloads be the ashes of Elon Musk?"	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-09-17T09:27:57Z	UCTj-gjadkhFchYclNve5IfQ	none		UgzbFfLG1AVd411NJSp4AaABAg

2. If something goes wrong with the ship and in need of parts or supplies etc there are no space garages.
3.micrometeorites – May  damage spacecraft and  penetrate astronauts space suit during spacewalks.

You forgot to tell us about other very important problem: how are those 1000 ships (or whichever of them make it to the alpha centauri) suppose to manage to BREAK or reduce velocity until they get there?? are the lasers gonna power them only a small fraction of the way?? if so, it cant take 20 years to get there if 20% of the speed of light is not kept until the ships arrive there, it will take much more... and if its kept at 20% speed of light all the way until it arrive there, then how can it possibly reduce speed to take those said pictures it is suppose to take??? i doubt u can take pictures while moving at the speed of light....	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-08-06T05:00:48Z	UCPcwmrhmuIMfi50SyBRos7w	none		UgzY130IC-QYvBT7xlp4AaABAg

To travel interstellar distances we must escape the limits currently imposed on us by our technology and our budgets. Stop wishing. Move outside the square that imprisons us. Someone, somewhere has already conceived of an idea that is feasible, even if not with our current resources or technology. Organise brainstorming groups that invite these ideas, however apparently fanciful, and evaluate them. Don't wait for a Zefram Cochrane to do it all by himself - he may not have the resources. There IS a solution, or a number of them. And we don't have forever to do this.	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2019-01-07T07:24:53Z	UCNsUakZLPOM4ooJV9gnrk5A	none		UgwSH9DHOGsP1druyrR4AaABAg

[Pleidians] It's around 2040-2060, some ultra spiritual people can travel universe without high-tech spaceship, you are right, psychic abilities, but with normals, we can do it easily with the helps of many and many other humanoid civilizations in galaxy, Pleiadian is the first one, they are the most friendly race, to us.Not just Pleiadian, many friend are waiting. Of course helps, but our creativity ourself is needed too. We need forms of free and endless energy, like Zeropoint Energy, make spaceship travel through Magnetic Holes/Worm Hole/Potarl, created by balancing magnetic field, for example: [high speed spinning magnetic objects- ring]	3zMUJwGrn6Q	0	2018-11-30T09:35:34Z	UCn-Xn9pIbsPCpRao4c-VySA	none		Ugwq7nXQ8fgEDpENnKl4AaABAg
